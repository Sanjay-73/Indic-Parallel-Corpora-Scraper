# Parallel Corpora Scraper

## Overview
The Parallel Corpora Scraper is a robust tool designed to extract parallel data from multiple web pages across various languages. This data, consisting of aligned text segments in different languages, is invaluable for training Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. The scraper leverages BeautifulSoup and Selenium to navigate and extract content, ensuring compatibility with dynamic web pages.

## Data Schema Overview
The structure of the data stored in our JSON files has been meticulously designed to align with the standards set forth by the WMT23 German-English document-level translation task. This schema ensures compatibility and relevance for contemporary NMT model training requirements.
