        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

        "article": "\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नमस्कार। फिर एक बार मुझे ‘मन की बात’ करने का अवसर मिला है। मेरे लिए ‘मन की बात’ ये कर्मकाण्ड नहीं है। मैं स्वयं भी आपसे बातचीत करने के लिए बहुत ही उत्सुक रहता हूँ और मुझे खुशी है कि हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में मन की बातों के माध्यम से देश के सामान्यजनों से मैं जुड़ पाता हूँ। मैं आकाशवाणी का भी इसलिए भी आभारी हूँ कि उन्होंने इस ‘मन की बात’ को शाम को 8.00 बजे प्रादेशिक भाषाओं में प्रस्तुत करने का सफल प्रयास किया है। और मुझे इस बात की भी खुशी है कि जो लोग मुझे सुनते हैं, वे बाद में पत्र के द्वारा, टेलीफोन के द्वारा, MyGov website के द्वारा, Narendra Modi App के द्वारा अपनी भावनाओं को मेरे तक पहुंचाते हैं। बहुत सी आपकी बातें मुझे सरकार के काम में मदद करती हैं। जनहित की दृष्टि से सरकार कितनी सक्रिय होनी चाहिए, जनहित के काम कितने प्राथमिक होने चाहिए, इन बातों के लिए आपके साथ का मेरा ये सम्वाद, ये नाता बहुत काम आता है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि आप और अधिक सक्रिय हो करके लोक-भागीदारी से लोकतंत्र कैसे चले, इसको जरूर बल देंगे।\nगर्मी बढ़ती ही चली जा रही है। आशा करते थे, कुछ कमी आयेगी, लेकिन अनुभव आया कि गर्मी बढ़ती ही जा रही है। बीच में ये भी ख़बर आ गयी कि शायद मानसून एक सप्ताह विलम्ब कर जाएगा, तो चिंता और बढ़ गयी। क़रीब-क़रीब देश का अधिकतम हिस्सा गर्मी की भीषण आग का अनुभव कर रहा है। पारा आसमान को छू रहा है। पशु हो, पक्षी हो, इंसान हो, हर कोई परेशान है। पर्यावरण के कारण ही तो ये समस्याएँ बढ़ती चली जा रही हैं। जंगल कम होते गए, पेड़ कटते गए और एक प्रकार से मानवजाति ने ही प्रकृति का विनाश करके स्वयं के विनाश का मार्ग प्रशस्त कर दिया। 5 जून विश्व पर्यावरण दिवस है। पूरे विश्व में पर्यावरण के लिए चर्चाएँ होती हैं, चिंता होती है। इस बार United Nations ने विश्व पर्यावरण दिवस पर ‘Zero Tolerance for illegal Wildlife Trade’ इसको विषय रखा है। इसकी तो चर्चा होगी ही होगी, लेकिन हमें तो पेड़-पौधों की भी चर्चा करनी है, पानी की भी चर्चा करनी है, हमारे जंगल कैसे बढ़ें। क्योंकि आपने देखा होगा, पिछले दिनों उत्तराखण्ड, हिमाचल, जम्मू-कश्मीर – हिमालय की गोद में, जंगलों में जो आग लगी; आग का मूल कारण ये ही था कि सूखे पत्ते और कहीं थोड़ी सी भी लापरवाही बरती जाए, तो बहुत बड़ी आग में फैल जाती है और इसलिए जंगलों को बचाना, पानी को बचाना – ये हम सबका दायित्व बन जाता है। पिछले दिनों मुझे जिन राज्यों में अधिक सूखे की स्थिति है, ऐसे 11 राज्यों के मुख्यमंत्रियों के साथ विस्तार से बातचीत करने का अवसर मिला। उत्तर प्रदेश, राजस्थान, गुजरात, महाराष्ट्र, मध्य प्रदेश, छत्तीसगढ़, झारखंड, कर्नाटक, आंध्र प्रदेश, तेलंगाना, ओडिशा – वैसे तो सरकार की जैसे परम्परा रही है, मैं सभी सूखा प्रभावित राज्यों की एक meeting कर सकता था, लेकिन मैंने ऐसा नहीं किया। मैंने हर राज्य के साथ अलग meeting की। एक-एक राज्य के साथ क़रीब-क़रीब दो-दो, ढाई-ढाई घंटे बिताए। राज्यों को क्या कहना है, उनको बारीकी से सुना। आम तौर पर सरकार में, भारत सरकार से कितने पैसे गए और कितनों का खर्च हुआ – इससे ज्यादा बारीकी से बात नहीं होती है। हमारे भारत सरकार के भी अधिकारियों के लिए भी आश्चर्य था कि कई राज्यों ने बहुत ही उत्तम प्रयास किये हैं, पानी के संबंध में, पर्यावरण के संबंध में, सूखे की स्थिति को निपटने के लिये, पशुओं के लिये, असरग्रस्त मानवों के लिये और एक प्रकार से पूरे देश के हर कोने में, किसी भी दल की सरकार क्यों न हो, ये अनुभव आया कि इस समस्या की, लम्बी अवधि की परिस्थिति से, निपटने के लिए permanent solutions क्या हों, कायमी उपचार क्या हो, उस पर भी ध्यान था। एक प्रकार से मेरे लिए वो learning experience भी था और मैंने तो मेरे नीति आयोग को कहा है कि जो best practices हैं, उनको सभी राज्यों में कैसे लिया जाए, उस पर भी कोई काम होना चाहिए। कुछ राज्यों ने, खास करके आन्ध्र ने, गुजरात ने technology का भरपूर उपयोग किया है। मैं चाहूँगा कि आगे नीति आयोग के द्वारा राज्यों के जो विशेष सफल प्रयास हैं, उसको हम और राज्यों में भी पहुँचाएँ। ऐसी समस्याओं के समाधान में जन-भागीदारी एक बहुत बड़ा सफलता का आधार होती है। और उसमें अगर perfect planning हो, उचित technology का उपयोग हो और समय-सीमा में व्यवस्थाओं को पूर्ण करने का प्रयास किया जाए; उत्तम परिणाम मिल सकते हैं, ऐसा मेरा विश्वास है। Drought Management को ले करके, water conservation को ले करके, बूँद-बूँद पानी बचाने के लिये, क्योंकि मैं हमेशा मानता हूँ, पानी – ये परमात्मा का प्रसाद है। जैसे हम मंदिर में जाते हैं, कोई प्रसाद दे और थोड़ा सा भी प्रसाद गिर जाता है, तो मन में क्षोभ होता है। उसको उठा लेते हैं और पाँच बार परमात्मा से माफी माँगते हैं। ये पानी भी परमात्मा का प्रसाद है। एक बूँद भी बर्बाद हो, तो हमें पीड़ा होनी चाहिए। और इसलिए जल-संचय का भी उतना ही महत्व है, जल-संरक्षण का भी उतना ही महत्व है, जल-सिंचन का भी उतना ही महत्व है और इसीलिये तो per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation, कम-से-कम पानी से होने वाली फसल। अब तो खुशी की बात है कि कई राज्यों में हमारे गन्ने के किसान भी micro-irrigation का उपयोग कर रहे हैं, कोई drip-irrigation का उपयोग कर रहा है, कोई sprinkler का कर रहा है। मैं राज्यों के साथ बैठा, तो कुछ राज्यों ने paddy के लिए भी, rice की जो खेती करते हैं, उन्होंने भी सफलतापूर्वक drip-irrigation का प्रयोग किया है और उसके कारण उनकी पैदावार भी ज्यादा हुई, पानी भी बचा और मजदूरी भी कम हुई। इन राज्यों से मैंने जब सुना, तो बहुत से राज्य ऐसे हैं कि जिन्होंने बहुत बड़े-बड़े target लिए हैं, खास करके महाराष्ट्र, आन्ध्र और गुजरात। तीन राज्यों ने drip-irrigation में बहुत बड़ा काम किया है और उनकी तो कोशिश है कि हर वर्ष दो-दो, तीन-तीन लाख हेक्टेयर micro-irrigation में जुड़ते जाएँ! ये अभियान अगर सभी राज्यों में चल पड़ा, तो खेती को भी बहुत लाभ होगा, पानी का भी संचय होगा। हमारे तेलंगाना के भाइयों ने ‘मिशन भागीरथी’ के द्वारा गोदावरी और कृष्णा नदी के पानी का बहुत ही उत्तम उपयोग करने का प्रयास किया है। आन्ध्र प्रदेश ने ‘नीरू प्रगति मिशन’ उसमें भी technology का उपयोग, ground water recharging का प्रयास। महाराष्ट्र ने जो जन-आंदोलन खड़ा किया है, उसमें लोग पसीना भी बहा रहे हैं, पैसे भी दे रहे हैं। ‘जलयुक्त शिविर अभियान’ – सचमुच में ये आन्दोलन महाराष्ट्र को भविष्य के संकट से बचाने के लिए बहुत काम आएगा, ऐसा मैं अनुभव करता हूँ। छत्तीसगढ़ ने ‘लोकसुराज – जलसुराज अभियान’ चलाया है। मध्य प्रदेश ने ‘बलराम तालाब योजना’ – क़रीब-क़रीब 22 हज़ार तालाब! ये छोटे आँकड़े नही हैं! इस पर काम चल रहा है। उनका ‘कपिलधारा कूप योजना’। उत्तर प्रदेश से ‘मुख्यमंत्री जल बचाओ अभियान’। कर्नाटक में ‘कल्याणी योजना’ के रूप में कुओं को फिर से जीवित करने की दिशा में काम आरम्भ किया है। राजस्थान और गुजरात जहाँ अधिक पुराने जमाने की बावड़ियाँ हैं, उनको जलमंदिर के रूप में पुनर्जीवित करने का एक बड़ा अभियान चलाया है। राजस्थान ने ‘मुख्यमंत्री जल-स्वावलंबन अभियान’ चलाया है। झारखंड वैसे तो जंगली इलाका है, लेकिन कुछ इलाके हैं, जहाँ पानी की दिक्कत है। उन्होंने ‘Check Dam’ का बहुत बड़ा अभियान चलाया है। उन्होंने पानी रोकने की दिशा में प्रयास चलाया है। कुछ राज्यों ने नदियों में ही छोटे-छोटे बाँध बना करके दस-दस, बीस-बीस किलोमीटर पानी रोकने की दिशा में अभियान चलाया है। ये बहुत ही सुखद अनुभव है। मैं देशवासियों को भी कहता हूँ कि ये जून, जुलाई, अगस्त, सितम्बर – हम तय करें, पानी की एक बूँद भी बर्बाद नहीं होने देंगे। अभी से प्रबंध करें, पानी बचाने की जगह क्या हो सकती है, पानी रोकने की जगह क्या हो सकती है। ईश्वर तो हमारी ज़रूरत के हिसाब से पानी देता ही है, प्रकृति हमारी आवश्यकता की पूर्ति करती ही है, लेकिन हम अगर बहुत पानी देख करके बेपरवाह हो जाएँ और जब पानी का मौसम समाप्त हो जाए, तो बिना पानी परेशान रहें, ये कैसे चल सकता है? और ये कोई पानी मतलब सिर्फ किसानों का विषय नहीं है जी! ये गाँव, ग़रीब, मजदूर, किसान, शहरी, ग्रामीण, अमीर-ग़रीब – हर किसी से जुड़ा हुआ विषय है और इसलिए बारिश का मौसम आ रहा है, तो पानी ये हमारी प्राथमिकता रहे और इस बार जब हम दीवाली मनाएँ, तो इस बात का आनंद भी लें कि हमने कितना पानी बचाया, कितना पानी रोका। आप देखिये, हमारी खुशियाँ अनेक गुना बढ़ जाएँगी। पानी में वो ताक़त है, हम कितने ही थक करके आए हों, मुँह पर थोड़ा-सा भी पानी छिड़कते हैं, तो कितने fresh हो जाते हैं। हम कितने ही थक गए हों, लेकिन विशाल सरोवर देखें या सागर का पानी देखें, तो कैसी विराटता का अनुभव होता है। ये कैसा अनमोल खजाना है परमात्मा का दिया हुआ! जरा मन से उसके साथ जुड़ जाएँ, उसका संरक्षण करें, पानी का संवर्द्धन करें, जल-संचय भी करें, जल-सिंचन को भी आधुनिक बनाएँ। इस बात को मैं आज बड़े आग्रह से कह रहा हूँ। ये मौसम जाने नहीं देना है। आने वाले चार महीने बूँद-बूँद पानी के लिए ‘जल बचाओ अभियान’ के रूप में परिवर्तित करना है और ये सिर्फ सरकारों का नहीं, राजनेताओं का नहीं, ये जन-सामान्य का काम है। media ने पिछले दिनों पानी की मुसीबत का विस्तार से वृत्तांत दिया। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि media पानी बचाने की दिशा में लोगों का मार्गदर्शन करे, अभियान चलाए और पानी के संकट से हमेशा की मुक्ति के लिए media भी भागीदार बने, मैं उनको भी निमंत्रित करता हूँ।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, हमें आधुनिक भारत बनाना है। हमें transparent भारत बनाना है। हमें बहुत सी व्यवस्थाओं को भारत के एक कोने से दूसरे कोने तक समान रूप से पहुँचाना है, तो हमारी पुरानी आदतों को भी थोड़ा बदलना पड़ेगा। आज मैं एक ऐसे विषय पर स्पर्श करना चाहता हूँ, जिस पर अगर आप मेरी मदद करें, तो हम उस दिशा में सफलतापूर्वक आगे बढ़ सकते हैं। हम सबको मालूम है, हमें स्कूल में पढ़ाया जाता था कि एक ज़माना था, जब सिक्के भी नहीं थे, नोट भी नहीं थे, barter system हुआ करता था कि आपको अगर सब्जी चाहिए, तो बदले में इतने गेहूँ दे दो। आपको नमक चाहिए, तो बदले में इतनी सब्जी दे दो। barter system से ही कारोबार चलता था। धीरे-धीरे करके मुद्रा आने लगी। coin आने लगे, सिक्के आने लगे, नोट आने लगे। लेकिन अब वक्त बदल चुका है। पूरी दुनिया cashless society की तरफ़ आगे बढ़ रही है। electronic technological व्यवस्था के द्वारा हम रुपये पा भी सकते हैं, रुपये दे भी सकते हैं। चीज़ खरीद भी सकते हैं, बिल चुकता भी कर सकते हैं। और इससे ज़ेब में से कभी बटुए की चोरी होने का तो सवाल ही नहीं उठेगा। हिसाब रखने की भी चिंता नहीं रहेगी, automatic हिसाब रहेगा। शुरुआत थोड़ी कठिन लगेगी, लेकिन एक बार आदत लगेगी, तो ये व्यवस्था सरल हो जायेगी। और ये संभावना इसलिए है कि हमने इन दिनों जो ‘प्रधानमंत्री जन धन योजना’ का अभियान चलाया, देश के क़रीब-क़रीब सभी परिवारों के बैंक खाते खुल गए। दूसरी तरफ आधार नंबर भी मिल गया और मोबाइल तो क़रीब-क़रीब हिन्दुस्तान के हर हिन्दुस्तानी के हाथ में पहुँच गया है। तो ‘जन-धन’, ‘आधार’ और ‘मोबाइल’ – (JAM), ‘J.A.M.’ इसका तालमेल करते हुए हम इस cashless society की तरफ़ आगे बढ़ सकते हैं। आपने देखा होगा कि Jan-Dhan account के साथ RuPay Card दिया गया है। आने वाले दिनों में ये कार्ड credit और debit – दोनों की दृष्टि से काम आने वाला है। और आजकल तो एक बहुत छोटा सा Instrument भी आ गया है, जिसको कहते हैं point of sale – P.O.S. – ‘POS’. उसकी मदद से आप, अपना आधार नंबर हो, RuPay Card हो, आप किसी को भी पैसा चुकता करना है, तो उससे दे सकते हैं। ज़ेब में से रुपये निकालने की, गिनने की, जरूरत ही नहीं है। साथ ले करके घूमने की जरुरत ही नहीं है। भारत सरकार ने जो कुछ initiative लिए हैं, उसमें एक ‘POS’ के द्वारा payment कैसे हो, पैसे कैसे लिए जाएँ। दूसरा काम हमने शुरू किया है ‘Bank on Mobile’ – Universal Payment interface banking transaction – ‘UPI’. तरीक़े को बदल कर रख देगा। आपके मोबाइल फोन के द्वारा money transaction करना बहुत ही आसान हो जाएगा और ख़ुशी की बात है कि N.P.C.I. और बैंक इस platform को mobile app के ज़रिये launch करने के लिए काम कर रहे हैं और अगर ये हुआ, तो शायद आपको RuPay Card को साथ रखने की भी ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ेगीI देश में क़रीब-क़रीब सवा-लाख banking correspondents के रूप में नौजवानों को भर्ती किया गया है। एक प्रकार से बैंक आपके द्वार पर – उस दिशा में काम किया है। Post Office को भी बैंकिंग सेवाओं के लिए सजग कर दिया गया है। इन व्यवस्थाओं का अगर हम उपयोग करना सीख लेंगे और आदत डालेंगे, तो फिर हमें ये currency की ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ेगी, नोटों की ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ेगी, पैसों की ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ेगी, कारोबार अपने-आप चलेगा और उसके कारण एक transparency आएगी। दो-नंबरी कारोबार बंद हो जाएँगे। काले धन का तो प्रभाव ही कम होता जाएगा, तो मैं देशवासियों से आग्रह करता हूँ कि हम शुरू तो करें। देखिए, एक बार शुरू करेंगे, तो बहुत सरलता से हम आगे बढ़ेंगे। आज से बीस साल पहले किसने सोचा था कि इतने सारे मोबाइल हमारे हर हाथ में होंगे। धीरे-धीरे आदत हो गई, अब तो उसके बिना रह नहीं सकते। हो सकता है ये cashless society भी वैसा ही रूप धारण कर ले, लेकिन कम समय में होगा तो ज्यादा अच्छा होगा।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियों, जब भी Olympic के खेल आते हैं और जब खेल शुरू हो जाते हैं, तो फिर हम सर पटक के बैठते हैं, हम Gold Medal में कितने पीछे रह गए, Silver मिला के नहीं मिला, Bronze से चलाए – न चलाए, ये रहता है। ये बात सही है कि खेल-कूद में हमारे सामने चुनौतियाँ बहुत हैं, लेकिन देश में एक माहौल बनना चाहिए। Rio Olympic के लिए जाने वाले हमारे खिलाड़ियों को प्रोत्साहित करने का, उनका हौसला बुलंद करने का, हर किसी ने अपने-अपने तरीक़े से। कोई गीत लिखे, कोई cartoon बनाए, कोई शुभकामनायें सन्देश दे, कोई किसी game को प्रोत्साहित करे, लेकिन पूरे देश को हमारे इन खिलाड़ियों के प्रति एक बड़ा ही सकारात्मक माहौल बनाना चाहिए। परिणाम जो आएगा – आएगा। खेल है – खेल है, जीत भी होती है, हार भी होती है, medal आते भी हैं, नहीं भी आते हैं, लेकिन हौसला बुलंद होना चाहिए और ये जब मैं बात करता हूँ, तब मैं हमारे खेल मंत्री श्रीमान सर्बानन्द सोनोवाल को भी एक काम के लिए मुझे मन को छू गया, तो मैं आपको कहना चाहता हूँ। हम सब लोग गत सप्ताह चुनाव के नतीजे क्या आएँगे, असम में क्या पत्र परिणाम आएँगे, उसी में लगे थे और श्रीमान सर्बानन्द जी तो स्वयं असम के चुनाव का नेतृत्व कर रहे थे, मुख्यमंत्री के उम्मीदवार थे, लेकिन वो भारत सरकार के मंत्री भी थे और मुझे ये जब जानकारी मिली, तो बड़ी ख़ुशी हुई कि वो असम चुनाव के result के पहले किसी को बताए बिना पटियाला पहुँच गए, पंजाब। आप सब को मालूम होगा Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports (NIS), जहाँ पर Olympic में जाने वाले हमारे खिलाड़ियों की training होती है, वो सब वही हैं। वे अचानक वहां पहुँच गए, खिलाड़ियों के लिए भी surprise था और खेल जगत के लिए भी surprise था कि कोई मंत्री इस प्रकार से इतनी चिंता करे। खिलाड़ियों की क्या व्यवस्था है, खाने की व्यवस्था क्या है, आवश्यकता के अनुसार nutrition food मिल रहा है कि नहीं मिल रहा है, उनकी body के लिए जो आवश्यक trainer हैं, वो trainer हैं कि नहीं हैं। Training के सारे machines ठीक चल रहे हैं कि नहीं चल रहे हैं। सारी बातें उन्होंने बारीकी से देखीं। एक-एक खिलाड़ी के कमरे को जाकर के देखा। खिलाड़ियों से विस्तार से बातचीत की, management से बात की, trainer से बात की, खुद ने सब खिलाड़ियों के साथ खाना भी खाया। चुनाव नतीजे आने वाले हों, मुख्यमंत्री के नाते नये दायित्व की संभावना हो, लेकिन फिर भी अगर मेरा एक साथी खेल मंत्री के रूप में इस काम की इतनी चिंता करे, तो मुझे आनंद होता है। और मुझे विश्वास है, हम सब इसी प्रकार से खेल के महत्व को समझें। खेल जगत के लोगों को प्रोत्साहित करें, हमारे खिलाड़ियों को प्रोत्साहित करें। ये अपने-आप में बहुत बड़ी ताक़त बन जाती है जी, जब खिलाड़ी को लगता है कि सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासी उसके साथ खड़े हैं, तो उसका हौसला बुलंद हो जाता है।\nपिछली बार मैंने FIFA Under-17 World Cup के लिए बातें की थी और मुझे जो सुझाव आये देश भर से, और इन दिनों मैंने देखा है कि Football का एक माहौल पूरे देश में नज़र आने लगा है। कई लोग initiative लेकर अपनी-अपनी टीमें बना रहे हैं। Narendra Modi Mobile App पर मुझे हज़ारों सुझाव मिले हैं। हो सकता है, बहुत लोग खेलते नहीं होंगे, लेकिन देश के हज़ारों-लाखों नौजवानों की खेल में इतनी रूचि है, ये अपने-आप में मेरे लिए सुखद अनुभव था। क्रिकेट और भारत का लगाव तो हम जानते हैं, लेकिन मैंने देखा Football में भी इतना लगाव। ये अपने-आप में बड़ा ही एक सुखद भविष्य का संकेत देता है। तो Rio Olympic के लिए पसंदगी के पात्र हमारे सभी खिलाड़ियों के प्रति हम लोग एक उमंग और उत्साह का माहौल बनाएँ आने वाले दिनों में। हर चीज़ को जीत और हार की कसौटी से न कसा जाये। sportsman spirit के साथ भारत दुनिया में अपनी पहचान बनाए। मैं देशवासियों से अपील करता हूँ कि हमारे खेल जगत से जुड़े साथियों के प्रति उत्साह और उमंग का माहौल बनाने में हम भी कुछ करें।\nपिछले आठ-दस दिन से कहीं-न-कहीं से नये-नये result आ रहे हैंI मैं चुनाव के result की बात नहीं कर रहा हूँ। मैं उन विद्यार्थियों की बात कर रहा हूँ, जिन्होंने साल भर कड़ी मेहनत की, exam दी, 10th के, 12th के, एक के बाद एक result आना शुरू हुआ है। ये तो साफ़ हो गया है कि हमारी बेटियाँ पराक्रम दिखा रही हैं। ख़ुशी की बात है। इन परिणामों में जो सफल हुए हैं, उनको मेरी शुभकामना है, बधाई है। जो सफल नहीं हो पाए हैं, उनको मैं फिर से एक बार कहना चाहूँगा कि ज़िंदगी में करने के लिए बहुत-कुछ होता है। अगर हमारी इच्छा के मुताबिक परिणाम नहीं आया है, तो कोई ज़िंदगी अटक नहीं जाती है। विश्वास से जीना चाहिए, विश्वास से आगे बढ़ना चाहिए। लेकिन एक बड़े नए प्रकार का मेरे सामने प्रश्न आया है और मैंने वैसे इस विषय में कभी सोचा नहीं था। लेकिन मेरे MyGov पर एक e-mail आया, तो मेरा ध्यान गया। मध्य प्रदेश के कोई Mr. गौरव हैं, गौरव पटेल – उन्होंने एक बड़ी अपनी कठिनाई मेरे सामने प्रस्तुत की है। गौरव पटेल कह रहे हैं कि M.P. के board exam में मुझे 89.33 percent मिले हैं। तो ये पढ़ के मुझे तो लगा, वाह, क्या ख़ुशी की बात है, लेकिन आगे वो अपने दुःख की कथा कह रहे हैं। गौरव पटेल कह रहे हैं कि साहब, 89.33 percent marks लेकर जब मैं घर पहुँचा, तो मैं सोच रहा था कि चारों तरफ़ से मुझे बधाइयाँ मिलेंगी, अभिनन्दन होगा; लेकिन मैं हैरान था, घर में हर किसी ने मुझे यही कहा, अरे यार, चार marks ज्यादा आते, तेरा 90 percent हो जाता। यानि, मेरे परिवार और मेरे मित्र, मेरे teacher – कोई भी मेरे 89.33 percent marks से प्रसन्न नहीं था। हर कोई मुझे कह रहा था, यार, चार marks के लिए तुम्हारा 90 percent रह गया। अब मैं इस बात को समझ नहीं पा रहा हूँ कि ऐसी स्थिति को कैसे मैं handle करूँ। क्या ज़िंदगी में यही सब कुछ है क्या? क्या मैंने जो किया, वो अच्छा नहीं था क्या? क्या मैं भी कुछ कम पड़ गया क्या? पता नहीं, मेरे मन पर एक बोझ सा अनुभव होता है।\nगौरव, आपकी चिट्ठी को मैंने बहुत ध्यान से पढ़ा है और मुझे लगता है, शायद ये वेदना आपकी ही नहीं, आपके जैसे लाखों-करोड़ो विद्यार्थियों की होगी, क्योंकि एक ऐसा माहौल बन गया है कि जो हुआ है, उसके प्रति संतोष के बजाय उसमें से असंतोष खोजना, ये नकारात्मकता का दूसरा रूप है। हर चीज़ में से असंतोष खोजने से समाज को संतोष की दिशा में हम कभी नहीं ले जा सकते हैं। अच्छा होता, आपके परिजनों ने, आपके साथियों ने, मित्रों ने आपके 89.33 percent को सराहा होता, तो आपको अपने-आप ही ज्यादा कुछ करने का मन कर जाता। मैं अभिभावकों से, आसपास के लोगों से ये आग्रह करता हूँ कि आपके बच्चे जो result लेकर आए हैं, उसको स्वीकार कीजिए, स्वागत कीजिए, संतोष व्यक्त कीजिए और उसको आगे बढ़ने के लिए प्रोत्साहित कीजिए, वरना हो सकता है, वो दिन ये भी आएगा कि आपको 100 percent आने के बाद आप कहें कि भई 100 आया, लेकिन फिर भी तुम कुछ ऐसा करते तो अच्छा होते, तो हर चीज़ की कुछ तो मर्यादा रहनी ही चाहिए।\nमुझे जोधपुर से संतोष गिरि गोस्वामी – उन्होंने भी लिखा है, करीब-करीब इसी प्रकार से लिखा है। वे कहते हैं कि मेरे आस-पास के लोग हमारे परिणाम को स्वीकार ही नही कर रहे हैं। वो तो कहते हैं कि कुछ और अच्छा कर लेते, कुछ और अच्छा कर लेते। मुझे कविता पूरी याद नहीं है, लेकिन बहुत पहले मैंने पढी थी, किसी कवि ने लिखी थी कि ज़िन्दगी के Canvas पर मैंने वेदना का चित्र बनाया। और जब उसकी प्रदर्शनी थी, लोग आए, हर किसी ने कहा, touch-up की ज़रूरत है, कोई कहता था कि नीले की बजाए पीला होता, तो अच्छा होता; कोई कहता था, ये रेखा यहाँ के बजाये उधर होती, तो अच्छा होता। काश, मेरी इस वेदना के चित्र पर किसी एकाध दर्शक ने भी तो आंसू बहाए होते। ये कविता के शब्द यही थे, ऐसा मुझे अब याद नहीं रहा, लेकिन बहुत पहले की कविता है तो, लेकिन भाव यही था। उस चित्र में से कोई वेदना नहीं समझ पाया, हर कोई touch-up की बात कर रहा था। संतोष गिरि जी, आप की चिंता भी वैसी है, जैसी गौरव की है और आप जैसे करोड़ों विद्यार्थियों की होगी। लोगों की अपेक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने के लिए आप पर बोझ बनता है। मैं तो आप से इतना ही कहूँगा कि ऐसी स्थिति में आप अपना संतुलन मत खोइए। हर कोई अपेक्षायें व्यक्त करता है, सुनते रहिये, लेकिन अपनी बात पर डटे रहिये और कुछ अधिक अच्छा करने का प्रयास भी करते रहिये। लेकिन जो मिला है, उस पर संतोष नहीं करोगे, तो फिर नयी इमारत कभी नहीं बना पाओगेI सफलता की मजबूत नींव ही बड़ी सफलता का आधार बनती है। सफलता में से भी पैदा हुआ असंतोष सफलता की सीढ़ी नही बना पाता, वो असफलता की guarantee बन जाता है। और इसलिए मैं आप से आग्रह करूँगा कि जितनी सफलता मिली है, उस सफलता को गुनगुनाओ, उसी में से नयी सफलता की संभावनायें पैदा होंगी। लेकिन ये बात मैं अड़ोस-पड़ोस और माँ-बाप और साथियों से ज्यादा कहना चाहता हूँ कि आप अपने बच्चों के साथ कृपा करके आपकी अपेक्षायें उन पर मत थोपिए। और दोस्तो, क्या कभी-कभी ज़िन्दगी में असफल हुए, तो क्या वो ज़िन्दगी ठहर जाती है क्या? जो कभी exam में अच्छे marks नहीं ला सकता, वो sports में बहुत आगे निकल जाता है, संगीत में आगे निकल जाता है, कलाकारीगरी में आगे निकल जाता है, व्यापार में आगे निकल जाता है। ईश्वर ने हर किसी को कोई-ना-कोई तो अद्भुत विधा दी ही होती है। बस, आप के अपने भीतर की शक्ति को पहचानिए, उस पर बल दीजिए, आप आगे निकल जाएँगे। और ये जीवन में हर जगह पर होता है। आप ने संतूर नाम के वाद्य को सुना होगा। एक ज़माना था, संतूर वाद्य कश्मीर की घाटी मे folk music के साथ जुड़ा हुआ था। लेकिन एक पंडित शिव कुमार थे, जिन्होंने उसको हाथ लगाया और आज दुनिया का एक महत्वपूर्ण वाद्य बना दिया। शहनाई – शहनाई हमारे संगीत के पूरे क्षेत्र में सीमित जगह पर था। ज्यादातर राजा-महाराजाओं के जो दरबार हुआ करते थे, उसके gate पर उसका स्थान रहता था। लेकिन जब उस्ताद बिस्मिल्ला खां ने जब शहनाई को हाथ लगाया, तो आज विश्व का उत्तम सा वाद्य बन गया, उसकी एक पहचान बन गई है। और इसलिए आप के पास क्या है, कैसा है, इसकी चिंता छोड़िए, उस पर आप जुट जाइए, जुट जाइए। परिणाम मिलेगा ही मिलेगा।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, कभी-कभी मैं देखता हूँ कि हमारे ग़रीब परिवारों का भी आरोग्य को लेकर के जो खर्च होता है, वो जिन्दगी की पटरी को असंतुलित कर देता है। और ये सही है कि बीमार न होने का खर्चा बहुत कम होता है, लेकिन बीमार होने के बाद स्वस्थ होने का खर्चा बहुत ज्यादा होता है। हम ऐसी जिन्दगी क्यों न जियें, ताकि बीमारी आये ही नहीं, परिवार पर आर्थिक बोझ हो ही नहीं। एक तो स्वच्छता बीमारी से बचाने का सबसे बड़ा आधार है। ग़रीब की सबसे बड़ी सेवा अगर कोई कर सकता है, तो स्वच्छता कर सकती है। और दूसरा जिसके लिए मैं लगातार आग्रह करता हूँ, वो है योग। कुछ लोग उसको ‘योगा’ भी कहते हैं। 21 जून अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय योग दिवस है। पूरे विश्व मे योग के प्रति एक आकर्षण भी है, श्रद्धा भी है और विश्व ने इसको स्वीकार किया है। हमारे पूर्वजों की हमें दी हुई एक अनमोल भेंट है, जो हमने विश्व को दी है। तनाव से ग्रस्त विश्व को संतुलित जीवन जीने की ताकत योग देता है। “Prevention is better than cure”. योग से जुड़े हुये व्यक्ति के जीवन में स्वस्थ रहना, संतुलित रहना, मज़बूत इच्छा-शक्ति के धनी होना, अप्रतिम आत्मविश्वास से भरा जीवन होना, हर काम में एकाग्रता का होना – ये सहज उपलब्धियां होती हैं। 21 जून – योग दिवस, ये सिर्फ एक event नहीं है, इसका व्याप बढ़े, हर व्यक्ति के जीवन में उसका स्थान बने, हर व्यक्ति अपनी दिनचर्या में 20 मिनट, 25 मिनट, 30 मिनट योग के लिए खपाए। और इसके लिए 21 जून योग दिवस हमें प्रेरणा देता है। और कभी-कभी सामूहिक वातावरण व्यक्ति के जीवन में बदलाव लाने का कारण बनता है। मैं आशा करता हूँ, 21 जून आप जहाँ भी रहते हों, आपके initiative के लिए अभी एक महीना है। आप भारत सरकार की website पर जाओगे, तो योग का जो इस बार का syllabus है, कौन-कौन से आसन करने हैं, किस प्रकार से करने हैं, इसका पूरा वर्णन है उसमें; उसको देखिये, आपके गाँव में करवाइए, आपके मोहल्ले में करवाइए, आपके शहर में करवाइए, आपके स्कूल में, institution में, even offices में भी। अभी से एक महीना शुरू कर दीजिये, देखिये, आप 21 जून को भागीदार बन जाएँगे। मैंने कई बार पढ़ा है कि कई offices में regularly सुबह मिलते ही योग और प्राणायाम सामूहिक होता है, तो पूरे office की efficiency इतनी बढ़ जाती है, पूरे office का culture बदल जाता है, environment बदल जाता है। क्या 21 जून का उपयोग हम अपने जीवन में योग लाने के लिए कर सकते हैं, अपने समाज जीवन में योग लाने के लिए कर सकते हैं, अपने आस-पास के परिसर में योग लाने के लिए कर सकते हैं? मैं इस बार चंडीगढ़ के कार्यक्रम में शरीक होने के लिए जाने वाला हूँ, 21 जून को चंडीगढ़ के लोगों के साथ मैं योग करने वाला हूँ। आप भी उस दिन अवश्य जुडें, पूरा विश्व योग करने वाला है। आप कहीं पीछे न रह जाएँ, ये मेरा आग्रह है। आप का स्वस्थ रहना भारत को स्वस्थ बनाने के लिए बहुत आवश्यक है।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, ‘मन की बात’ के द्वारा आपसे मैं लगातार जुड़ता हूँ। मैंने बहुत पहले आप को एक mobile number दिया था। उस पर missed call करके आप ‘मन की बात’ सुन सकते थे, लेकिन अब उसको बहुत आसान कर दिया है। अब ‘मन की बात’ सुनने के लिए अब सिर्फ 4 ही अंक – उसके द्वारा missed call करके ‘मन की बात’ सुन सकते हैं। वो चार आँकड़ों का number है- ‘उन्नीस सौ बाईस-1922-1922’ – इस number पर missed call करने से आप जब चाहें, जहाँ चाहें, जिस भाषा में चाहें, ‘मन की बात’ सुन सकते हैं।\nप्यारे देशवासियो, आप सब को फिर से नमस्कार। मेरी पानी की बात मत भूलना। याद रहेगी न? ठीक है। धन्यवाद। नमस्ते।\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake.

Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’.

Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’.

One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

અને\nઆથી જ એક ટીપે\nવધુ પાક,\nમાઇક્રો\nઇરિગેશન\nઓછામાં ઓછા\nપાણીથી થતો\nપાક, હવે તો\nઆનંદની વાત છે\nકે, અનેક\nરાજયોમાં\nઆપણા શેરડીના\nખેડૂતો પણ માઇક્રો\nઇરિગેશનનો ઉપયોગ\nકરી રહ્યા

ગૌરવ\nપટેલ કહે છે કે,\nમધ્યપ્રદેશની\nબોર્ડ\nપરીક્ષામાં\nમને 89.33 ટકા\nમળ્યા છે. તો\nવાંચીને મને\nલાગ્યું કે\nવાહ, શું\nઆનંદની વાત\nછે. પણ આગળ તેઓ\nપોતાના\nદુઃખની કથા\nકહી રહ્યા છે.\nગૌરવ પટેલ કહી\nરહ્યા છે કે\nસાહેબ 89.33 ટકા\nમાર્ક\nમેળવીને\nજયારે હું ઘરે\nપહોંચ્યો તો\nહું વિચારી\nરહ્યો હતો કે,\nબધી બાજુથી\nમને અભિનંદન\nમળશે પણ મને\nઆશ્ચર્ય થયું.\nઘરમાં બધાએ\nમને એમ જ\nકહ્યું અરે\nયાર, ચાર\nમાર્ક વધુ\nઆવ્યા હોત તો\nતારા 90 ટકા થઇ\nજાત. એટલે કે\nમારા પરિવાર\nઅને મારા મિત્ર,\nમારા શિક્ષક\nકોઇપણ મારા 89.33\nટકા માર્કથી\nપ્રસન્ન\nનહોતું. દરેક\nજણ મને કહેતું\nહતું, યાર ચાર\nમાર્ક માટે તારા\n90 ટકા ન આવ્યા.\nહવે હું એ વાત\nનથી સમજી શકતો\nકે આવી\nસ્થિતિને હું\nકેવી રીતે\nસંભાળું. શું\nજિંદગીમાં આ\nબધું જ છે ? મે\nજે કર્યું તે\nસારૂં નહોતું ? શું\nહું નબળો પડી\nગયો ? ખબર નથી,\nમારા મન પર એક\nબોજનો અનુભવ\nથાય છે.\n\n\n\nગૌરવ,\nતમારા પત્રને\nમે ઘણા ધ્યાનથી\nવાંચ્યો છે\nઅને મને લાગે\nછે કે, કદાચ આ\nવેદના તમારી જ\nનહીં, તમારા\nજેવા લાખો\nકરોડો\nવિદ્યાર્થીઓની\nહશે કારણ કે,\nએક એવું વાતાવરણ\nબની ગયું છે\nકે, જે થયું છે\nતેના પ્રત્યે\nસંતોષના બદલે તેમાંથી\nઅસંતોષ શોધવો,\nતે\nનકારાત્મકતાનું\nબીજું રૂપ છે.\nદરેક\nબાબતમાંથી\nઅસંતોષ\nશોધવાથી\nસમાજને સંતોષની\nદિશામાં આપણે\nનથી લઇ જઇ\nશકતા. સારૂં\nથયું હોત જો\nતમારા\nકુટુંબીજનોએ,\nતમારા સાથીઓએ,\nમિત્રોએ\nતમારા 89.33 ટકા\nમાર્કની પ્રશંસા\nકરી હોત તમને\nપોતાને જ\nથોડું વધુ\nકરવાનું મન\nથાત. હું વાલીઓને,\nઆસપાસના\nલોકોને આગ્રહ\nકરૂં છું કે,\nતમારાં બાળકો\nજે પરિણામ\nલાવ્યાં તેને\nસ્વીકાર કરો,\nસ્વાગત કરો,\nસંતોષ વ્યકત\nકરો અને તેમને\nઆગળ વધારવા\nપ્રોત્સાહિત\nકરો. નહીંતર\nએવું બની શકે\nકે, એ દિવસ પણ\nઆવશે કે તમને\nસો ટકા આવ્યા\nપછી તમે કહો\nકે ભાઇ સો ટકા\nઆવ્યા પરંતુ\nતમે કંઇક એવું\nકરત તો સારૂં\nહોત. તો દરેક\nબાબતની કંઇક\nમર્યાદા\nરહેવી જોઇએ.\n\n\n\nમને\nજોધપુરથી\nસંતોષગિરી\nગોસ્વામી\nતેમણે પણ\nલખ્યું છે,\nલગભગ આવું જ\nલખ્યું છે. તેઓ\nકહે છે કે,\nમારી આસપાસના\nલોકો મારા\nપરિણામને\nસ્વીકારતા જ\nનથી. તેઓ તો\nકહે છે કે,\nથોડું વધુ\nસારૂં કર્યું\nહોત તો, થોડું\nવધુ સારૂં\nકર્યું હોત\nતો, મને કવિતા\nપૂરી યાદ નથી\nપણ ઘણા સમય\nપહેલાં મેં\nવાંચી હતી,\nકોઇ કવિએ લખી\nહતી કે,\nજિંદગીના કેનવાસ\nપર મે\nવેદનાનું\nચિત્ર\nબનાવ્યું. અને\nજયારે તેની\nપ્રદર્શની\nહતી, લોકો\nઆવ્યા, દરેકે\nકહ્યું\n– ટચઅપની\nજરૂર હતી. કોઇ\nકહેતું હતું\nભૂરાના બદલે\nપીળો હોત તો\nસારૂં લાગત.\nકોઇ કહેતું\nહતું. આ રેખા\nઅહીંયાના\nબદલે ત્યાં\nહોત તો સારૂં હોત. કાશ,\nમારી આ\nવેદનાના\nચિત્ર પર કોઇ\nએકાદ દર્શકની\nઆંખમાં આંસુ\nઆવ્યા હોત. આ\nકવિતાના\nશબ્દો આ જ હતા\nએવું મને હવે\nયાદ નથી રહ્યું\nપરંતુ બહુ\nપહેલાની\nકવિતા છે.\nપરંતુ ભાવ આ જ\nહતો.\nચિત્રમાંથી\nકોઇ વેદના\nસમજી ન શક્યું,\nદરેક ટચ અપની\nવાત કરી\nરહ્યું હતું.\nસંતોષગિરીજી,\nતમારી પણ\nચિંતા એવી જ\nછે જેવી\nગૌરવની છે. અને\nતમારા જેવા\nકરોડો\nવિદ્યાર્થીઓની\nહશે. લોકોની\nઅપેક્ષાઓ\nપૂર્ણ કરવા\nમાટે તમારા પર\nબોજ સર્જાય\nછે. હું તો\nતમને એટલું જ\nકહીશ કે આવી\nસ્થિતિમાં\nતમે તમારૂં\nસંતુલન\nગુમાવશો નહીં.\nદરેક પોતાની\nઅપેક્ષાઓ\nવ્યક્ત કરે\nછે. તે\nસાંભળતા રહો\nપરંતુ પોતાની\nવાત પર અડગ\nરહો અને કંઇક\nવધુ સારૂં\nકરવાનો\nપ્રયાસ પણ\nકરતા રહો.\nપરંતુ જે\nમળ્યું છે\nતેના પર સંતોષ\nનહીં કરો તો\nપછી નવી ઇમારત\nકયારેય નહીં\nબનાવી શકો.\nમજબૂત પાયો જ\nસફળતાનો આધાર\nબને છે.\nસફળતામાંથી\nપણ ઉત્પન્ન થયેલો\nઅસંતોષ\nસફળતાની સીડી\nબની ન શકે, તે\nનિષ્ફળતાની\nગેરંટી બની\nજાય છે. અને\nઆથી હું આપને\nવિનંતી કરીશ\nકે જેટલી\nસફળતા મળી છે\nતે સફળતાને\nગણગણો.\nતેમાંથી જ નવી\nસફળતાની\nસંભાવનાઓ\nસર્જાશે.\nપરંતુ આ વાત\nહું પડોશના\nઅને માબાપ તથા\nસાથીઓને વધુ\nકહેવા માગું\nછું કે, તમે\nતમારા બાળકો\nપર કૃપા કરીને\nતમારી\nઅપેક્ષાઓ\nથોપો નહીં.\nઅને દોસ્તો,\nશું\nજિંદગીમાં\nકયારેય નિષ્ફળ\nથયા તો જિંદગી\nઅટકી જાય છે ?

એક\nમહત્વપૂર્ણ\nવાદ્ય બનાવી\nદીધું. શરણાઇ\nશરણાઇ આપણા\nસંગીતના\nસમગ્ર\nક્ષેત્રમાં\nસીમિત જગ્યા\nપર હતી.\nમોટાભાગે\nરાજા\nમહારાજાના જે\nદરબાર હતા\nતેના દરવાજા\nપર તેનું\nસ્થાન રહેતું હતું.\nપરંતુ

એ\nસાચું છે કે\nબીમાર ન થવાનો\nખર્ચો બહુ ઓછો\nહોય છે પણ\nબીમાર થયા પછી\nસ્વસ્થ થવાનો\nખર્ચો ઘણો વધુ\nહોય છે. આપણે\nએવી જિંદગી\nકેમ ન જીવીએ\nજેથી બીમારી\nઆવે જ નહીં.\nપરિવાર પર\nઆર્થિક બોજો\nપડે જ

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

ലഭിച്ചിരിക്കുന്നു. എന്നെ സംബന്ധിച്ചിടത്തോളം ‘മന്‍ കി ബാത്’ മനസ്സിലുള്ള കാര്യങ്ങളാണ്. ഇത് എന്റെ കര്‍മ്മമണ്ഡലം അല്ല. ഞാന്‍ സ്വയമേവതന്നെ താങ്കളോട് സംവദിക്കാന്‍ വളരെ താല്പര്യപ്പെട്ടുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. ഭാരതത്തിലെ ഓരോ മുക്കിലുംമൂലയിലും ‘മന്‍ കി ബാത്’ എന്ന പരിപാടിയില്‍ക്കൂടി ദേശവാസികളായ സാമാന്യജനങ്ങളുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെടാന്‍ എനിക്ക് കഴിയുന്നു. ‘മന്‍ കി ബാത്’ വൈകുന്നേരങ്ങളില്‍ 8 മണിയ്ക്ക് പ്രാദേശികഭാഷകളില്‍ അവതരിപ്പിക്കുന്നതുകൊണ്ട് ഞാന്‍ ആകാശവാണിയോട് കടപ്പെട്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. ഞാന്‍ പറയുന്ന കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ ആരെല്ലാമാണോ കേള്‍ക്കുന്നത് അവര്‍ പിന്നീട് കത്തുകളായും ടെലഫോണ്‍വഴിയും എന്റെ വൈബ്‌സൈറ്റുകളില്‍ക്കൂടിയും NarendraModiAppലൂടെയും തങ്ങളുടെ വികാരവിചാരങ്ങള്‍ എന്നില്‍ എത്തിച്ചു കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. അതില്‍ ഞാന്‍ അതീവ സന്തുഷ്ടനാണ്. ഇവയിലെ ഒട്ടേറെ നിര്‍ദ്ദേശങ്ങള്‍ എന്റെ ഗവണ്‍മെന്റിന്റെ പ്രവര്‍ത്തനങ്ങളെ സഹായിക്കുന്നുമുണ്ട്. ജനനന്മയ്ക്കായി സര്‍ക്കാരിനെ എത്രമാത്രം സജീവമാക്കാമോ ജനനന്മയ്ക്കായി എന്തെല്ലാം മുന്‍ഗണനക്രമങ്ങള്‍ നല്‍കാമോ അതിലെല്ലാം നിങ്ങളുടെ ഇടപെടലുകള്‍ വളെരയേറെ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുന്നു. നിങ്ങള്‍ കൂടുതല്‍ കൂടുതല്‍ കര്‍മ്മോത്സുകരായി നിങ്ങളുടെ പങ്കാളിത്തംവഴി ജനാധിപത്യത്തെ മുന്നോട്ടു നയിക്കാന്‍ പ്രാപ്തരാണെന്ന് ഞാന്‍ വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു.\nവേനല്‍ കടുത്തുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. വെയിലിന്റെ കാഠിന്യം കുറച്ചു കുറയുമെന്ന് കരുതി. എന്നാല്‍, ചൂട് കൂടിക്കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയാണ്. ഒരുപക്ഷേ, മഴക്കാലം തുടങ്ങുവാന്‍ ഒരാഴ്ച വൈകുമെന്നുള്ള വാര്‍ത്ത വരുന്നുണ്ട്. അതുകൊണ്ടുതന്നെ നമ്മുടെ ഉത്കണ്ഠയും കൂടി. ഏകദേശം രാജ്യത്തിന്റെ ഭൂരിഭാഗം പ്രദേശങ്ങളിലും വേനലിന്റെ ഭീകരമായ ചൂട് അനുഭവപ്പെട്ടുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. മൃഗങ്ങളായാലും, പക്ഷികളായാലും, മനുഷ്യരായാലും എല്ലാവരും വിഷമിക്കുന്നു. കാലാവസ്ഥാവ്യതിയാനം ഇത്തരം പ്രശ്‌നങ്ങളെ വര്‍ദ്ധിപ്പിക്കുന്നു. വനമേഖലയുടെ വിസ്തൃതി കുറഞ്ഞു. വൃക്ഷങ്ങള്‍ മുറിക്കപ്പെട്ടു. ഒരുവിധത്തില്‍ പറഞ്ഞാല്‍ മനുഷ്യര്‍തന്നെ പ്രകൃതിയെ നശിപ്പിച്ചിട്ട് സ്വയം വിനാശം വരുത്തിവയ്ക്കുന്നു. ജൂണ്‍ 5 ലോക പരിസ്ഥിതി ദിനമാണ്. ലോകമെമ്പാടും പരിസ്ഥിതിയെക്കുറിച്ചുള്ള ചര്‍ച്ചകള്‍ നടക്കുന്നു. ഇപ്രാവശ്യം ഐക്യരാഷ്ട്രസഭ ലോക പരിസ്ഥിതി ദിനത്തില്‍ Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wild Life Trade നെ വിഷയമാക്കിയിരിക്കുന്നു. ഇത് സംബന്ധമായ ചര്‍ച്ചകള്‍ നടക്കും. എന്നാല്‍, വൃക്ഷലതാദികളെകുറിച്ചും നമുക്ക് ചിന്തിക്കണം. ജലസംഭരണത്തെക്കുറിച്ചും ചര്‍ച്ച ചെയ്യണം. നമ്മുടെ വനമേഖലയെ എങ്ങനെ സമ്പന്നമാക്കാം എതിനെക്കുറിച്ചും ചര്‍ച്ച ചെയ്യേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. കഴിഞ്ഞ ദിവസങ്ങളില്‍ ഉത്തരാഖണ്ഡ്, ഹിമാചല്‍പ്രദേശ്, ജമ്മുകാശ്മീര്‍, ഹിമാലയ താഴ്‌വരകള്‍ എന്നിവിടങ്ങളിലെ കാടുകള്‍ അഗ്നിക്കിരയായി. ഇക്കാര്യം നിങ്ങള്‍ മനസ്സിലാക്കിയിരിക്കും. കരിയിലകളും നമ്മുടെ അശ്രദ്ധയും കാട്ടുതീയുടെ മൂലകാരണങ്ങളാണ്. വനം സംരക്ഷിക്കണം; ജലം സംരക്ഷിക്കണം. ഇത് നമ്മുടെ ഉത്തരവാദിത്വമാണ്. കഴിഞ്ഞ ദിവസങ്ങളില്‍ വേനല്‍ച്ചൂടില്‍ കഷ്ടപ്പെടുന്ന 11 സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളായ ഉത്തര്‍പ്രദേശ്, രാജസ്ഥാന്‍, ഗുജറാത്ത്, മഹാരാഷ്ട്ര, ഛത്തീസ്ഗഢ്, ജാര്‍ഖണ്ഡ്, കര്‍ണ്ണാടക, ആന്ധ്രാപ്രദേശ്, തെലുങ്കാന, ഒഡീഷ എിവിടങ്ങളിലെ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിമാരുമായി സംവദിക്കാനുള്ള അവസരം എനിയ്ക്ക് കിട്ടി. സാധാരണഗതിയില്‍ ഈ വരള്‍ച്ചബാധിത പ്രദേശങ്ങളെ ഉള്‍പ്പെടുത്തിക്കൊണ്ടുള്ള ഒരു യോഗം വിളിച്ചുകൂട്ടിയാല്‍ മതിയായിരുന്നു. പക്ഷേ, ഞാനങ്ങനെ ചെയ്തില്ല. പ്രത്യേകം പ്രത്യേകം യോഗങ്ങള്‍ വിളിച്ചുകൂട്ടി. ഓരോ ദേശക്കാര്‍ക്കുംവേണ്ടി ഏകദേശം രണ്ട് രണ്ടര മണിക്കൂറോളം ഞാന്‍ ചിലവിട്ടു. ഓരോ ദേശത്തിനും പറയാനുള്ളത് ശ്രദ്ധയോടെ കേട്ടു. സാധാരണഗതിയില്‍ കേന്ദ്ര ഗവണ്‍മെന്റ് എത്ര തുക അനുവദിച്ചുവെന്നും അതില്‍ എത്രമാത്രം ചെലവാക്കപ്പെട്ടുവെന്നും – മുമ്പെങ്ങും ഇതു സംബന്ധിച്ച് ഇത്രയും സൂക്ഷ്മമായ ഒരു ചര്‍ച്ച നടന്നിട്ടില്ല. പല പ്രദേശങ്ങളും ജലസംരക്ഷണം, പരിസ്ഥിതി, വരള്‍ച്ച ലഘൂകരണം, മൃഗസംരക്ഷണം എിവയ്ക്കുവേണ്ടിയും വരള്‍ച്ചാബാധിതര്‍ക്കുവേണ്ടിയും ഒരുവിധത്തില്‍ പറഞ്ഞാല്‍ മുഴുവന്‍ രാജ്യത്തിനുവേണ്ടിയും മികവുറ്റ പ്രവര്‍ത്തനം കാഴ്ചവച്ചു എന്ന വസ്തുത ഭാരതസര്‍ക്കാരിന്റെ അധികാരികളെപ്പോലും അമ്പരപ്പിക്കുന്ന ഒന്നായിരുന്നു. ഏതു പാര്‍ട്ടി ഭരിക്കുന്ന സര്‍ക്കാരായാലും ഇത്തരം പ്രശ്‌നങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് ദീര്‍ഘകാലാടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലുള്ള ശാശ്വത പരിഹാമാണ് വേണ്ടത്. എന്നെ സംബന്ധിച്ചിടത്തോളം അതൊരു പഠനാനുഭവംതെയായിരുന്നു. ഞാന്‍ നിതി ആയോഗിനോട് പറഞ്ഞു: അതില്‍നിന്നും നല്ല മാതൃകകള്‍ സ്വായത്തമാക്കിക്കൊണ്ട് അത് മറ്റു സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളിലും നടപ്പിലാക്കാനുള്ള നടപടികള്‍ സ്വീകരിക്കണമെന്ന്. ചില സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങള്‍ പ്രത്യേകിച്ചും ആന്ധ്ര, ഗുജറാത്ത് തുടങ്ങിയവ സാങ്കേതികവിദ്യ പൂര്‍ണ്ണമായും പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇനി സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളുടെ സഫലമായ പരീക്ഷണങ്ങള്‍ നിതി ആയോഗ് മുഖേന മറ്റ് പ്രദേശങ്ങളിലും എത്തിക്കണം എന്ന് ഞാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. ഇത്തരത്തിലുള്ള പ്രശ്‌നങ്ങളില്‍ ജനപങ്കാളിത്തം വിജയത്തിന്റെ വലിയ ഒരു അടിസ്ഥാനഘടകമാണ്. ഒരുപക്ഷേ, സമഗ്രമായ ആസൂത്രണം ഉണ്ടെങ്കില്‍ ഉചിതമായ സാങ്കേതികവിദ്യ ഉപയോഗപ്പെടുത്തിക്കൊണ്ട് സമയപരിധിക്കുള്ളില്‍ വ്യവസ്ഥകള്‍ പൂര്‍ത്തീകരിച്ചാല്‍ ഗണ്യമായ മാറ്റം ഉണ്ടാക്കാന്‍ കഴിയും. അങ്ങിനെ ഞാന്‍ വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു. വരള്‍ച്ചാ നിവാരണത്തിന്, ജലസംരക്ഷണത്തിന് ഓരോ തുള്ളി ജലവും സംരക്ഷിക്കുന്നതിനുവേണ്ടി …… എന്തെന്നാല്‍ ഞാന്‍ എല്ലായ്‌പ്പോഴും വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു ജലം ഈശ്വരന്‍ കനിഞ്ഞു നല്‍കിയ പ്രസാദമാണ്. നമ്മള്‍ അമ്പലങ്ങളില്‍ പോകുന്നു. പ്രസാദം കിട്ടുമ്പോള്‍ അതില്‍ നിന്ന് കുറച്ചു താഴെ പോയാല്‍ നമ്മുടെ മനസ്സിന് ക്ഷോഭം ഉണ്ടാകും. അതെടുത്തുകൊണ്ട് 5 പ്രാവശ്യമെങ്കിലും ഈശ്വരനോട് മാപ്പു ചോദിക്കുന്നു. ജലവും ഈശ്വരന്റെ പ്രസാദമായി കരുതി ഓരോ തുള്ളിയും നഷ്ടപ്പെടുമ്പോള്‍ നാം വേദനിക്കണം. ജലസംഭരണം മഹത്തായ ഒരു കാര്യമാണ്. ജലസംരക്ഷണവും അങ്ങിനെതന്നെ. ജലസേചനവും മഹത്വപൂര്‍ണമാണ്. അതുകൊണ്ടാണ് ‘per drop, more crop, micro irrigation” ഓരോ തുള്ളിയിലും കൂടുതല്‍ വിളവ്, സൂക്ഷ്മ ജലസേചനം തുടങ്ങിയവ ശ്രദ്ധേയമാണ്. പല സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളിലും നമ്മുടെ കരിമ്പു കര്‍ഷകര്‍ സൂക്ഷ്മജലസേചനം പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തുന്നു. ചിലര്‍ ഡ്രിപ് ഇറിഗേഷന്‍ ഉപയോഗപ്പെടുത്തുന്നു. വേറൊരു കൂട്ടര്‍ സ്പ്രിംഗ്ലര്‍ ഉപയോഗപ്പെടുത്തുന്നു. ഇതൊരു നല്ല കാര്യമാണ്. ചില സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങള്‍ ധാന്യകൃഷി, നെല്‍കൃഷി എന്നിവ ചെയ്യുന്നവരും ഡ്രിപ് ഇറിഗേഷന്‍ ഫലപ്രദമായി ഉപയോഗപ്പെടുത്തുന്നു. അക്കാര്യംകൊണ്ടുതന്നെ നല്ല വിളവ് ലഭിക്കുന്നു. ജലസംരക്ഷണം നടക്കുന്നു. കൂലി കുറച്ചു മതി. ഈ സ്ഥലങ്ങളില്‍നിന്നും ഞാന്‍ കേട്ടത് ചില പ്രദേശങ്ങള്‍ വലിയ വലിയ ലക്ഷ്യങ്ങള്‍ മുന്നില്‍കണ്ടുകൊണ്ട് നീങ്ങുന്നു. പ്രത്യേകിച്ചും, മഹാരാഷ്ട്രയും, ആന്ധ്രയും, ഗുജറാത്തും. ഈ മൂന്നു സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളും ഡ്രിപ് ഇറിഗേഷന്‍ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തി. ഓരോ വര്‍ഷവും രണ്ടും മൂന്നും ലക്ഷം ഹെക്ടര്‍ ഭൂമി അധികമായി മൈക്രോ ഇറിഗേഷനില്‍ ഉള്‍പ്പെടുത്താനാണ് അവരുടെ ലക്ഷ്യം. എല്ലാ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളും ഈ പദ്ധതികള്‍ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തിയാല്‍ കൃഷി ലാഭകരമാകും. ജലം സംരക്ഷിക്കാന്‍ കഴിയും. നമ്മുടെ തെലുങ്കാനയിലെ സഹോദരങ്ങള്‍ മിഷന്‍ ഭാഗീരഥിയില്‍ക്കൂടി ഗോദാവരി, കൃഷ്ണ തുടങ്ങിയ നദികളിലെ ജലം ഫലപ്രദമായി പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്താന്‍ ശ്രമിച്ചു. ആന്ധ്രാപ്രദേശ് ‘നീരു പ്രഗതി മിഷന്‍’, ജലസംരക്ഷണ പദ്ധതിയിലും ഈ സാങ്കേതികവിദ്യ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തി. ഗ്രൗണ്ട് വാട്ടര്‍ റീചാര്‍ജ്ജിനുവേണ്ടിയും പ്രയത്‌നിച്ചു. മഹാരാഷ്ട്രയിലെ ജനകീയ മുന്നേറ്റത്തില്‍ ജനങ്ങള്‍ കൂടുതല്‍ പ്രയത്‌നിക്കുകയും പണം ചെലവഴിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. ജലസംരക്ഷണപദ്ധതി സത്യം പറഞ്ഞാല്‍ ഈ ഒരു മുന്നേറ്റം മഹാരാഷ്ട്രയെ ഭാവിയില്‍ ഉണ്ടാകുന്ന വിഷമതകളില്‍നിന്ന് കരകയറാന്‍ ഏറെ സഹായകമാകുമെന്ന് ഞാന്‍ കരുതുന്നു.\nഛത്തീസ്ഗഢ് ‘ലോക് സുരാജ് ജല്‍ സുരാജ് അഭിയാന്‍’ നടപ്പിലാക്കിയി’ുണ്ട്. മധ്യപ്രദേശ് ‘ബല്‍റാം താലാബ് യോജന’യില്‍ ഏകദേശം 22,000 കുളങ്ങള്‍ ഉള്‍പ്പെടുത്തി. ഇതൊരു ചെറിയ കണക്കല്ല. അവരുടെ ‘കപില്‍ ധാരാ കൂപ് യോജന’ എടുത്തു പറയേണ്ടതാണ്. ഉത്തര്‍പ്രദേശില്‍ മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുടെ ജലസംരക്ഷണ പദ്ധതി, കര്‍ണാടകയിലെ കല്യാണി പദ്ധതിവഴി കിണറുകളെ പുനരുജ്ജീവിപ്പിക്കാനുള്ള കാര്യപരിപാടികള്‍ എന്നിവയ്ക്കും തുടക്കം കുറിച്ചുകഴിഞ്ഞു. രാജസ്ഥാനിലും ഗുജറാത്തിലും ധാരാളം പഴയ പൊട്ടക്കുളങ്ങള്‍ ഉണ്ട്. അവയെ ജലക്ഷേത്രം എന്ന രീതിയില്‍ പുനര്‍ജ്ജീവിപ്പിച്ചു. രാജസ്ഥാനില്‍ ‘മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി ജലസ്വാവലംബന്‍ അഭിയാന്‍’ എന്ന പേരില്‍ പദ്ധതി നടപ്പിലാക്കി. ജാര്‍ഖണ്ഡ് ഒരു വനപ്രദേശമാണ്. എന്നാല്‍ ചില പ്രദേശങ്ങളില്‍ ജലക്ഷാമം രൂക്ഷമാണ്. അവര്‍ ‘ചെക്ക്ഡാം’ പദ്ധതി നടപ്പില്‍വരുത്തി. അവര്‍ക്ക് ജലസംരക്ഷണമായിരുന്നു ലക്ഷ്യം. ചില സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളില്‍ ചെറിയ ചെറിയ അണകള്‍ നിര്‍മ്മിച്ച് 10ഉം 20ഉം കിലോമീറ്ററോളം ജലം സംരക്ഷിക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള പദ്ധതികള്‍ നടപ്പിലാക്കി. ഇത് നല്ലൊരു അനുഭവമാണ്. ജൂണ്‍, ജൂലൈ, ആഗസ്റ്റ്, സെപ്റ്റംബര്‍വരെ കിട്ടുന്ന മഴയുടെ ഒരു തുള്ളി ജലംപോലും നഷ്ടപ്പെടുത്തരുത് എന്ന് പറയാന്‍ ഞാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. ജലസംരക്ഷണത്തിനുള്ള സ്ഥലം എന്തായിരിക്കണമെന്നും എങ്ങിനെയായിരിക്കണമെന്നും ഇപ്പോഴേ നാം ചിന്തിക്കണം. നമ്മുടെ ആവശ്യത്തിനനുസരിച്ച് ഈശ്വരന്‍ ജലം പ്രദാനം ചെയ്തിട്ടുണ്ട്. പ്രകൃതി നമ്മുടെ ആവശ്യങ്ങള്‍ പൂര്‍ത്തീകരിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ധാരാളം ജലം കണ്ടിട്ട് നമ്മള്‍ അശ്രദ്ധരാകുകയും മഴക്കാലം കഴിയുമ്പോള്‍ നമ്മള്‍ ജലം കിട്ടാതെ വിഷമിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യും. എത്രനാള്‍ ഇങ്ങനെ കഴിയും. ഇത് കൃഷിക്കാരുടെ വിഷയം മാത്രമല്ല, ഗ്രാമീണര്‍, പാവപ്പെട്ടവര്‍, കൂലിക്കാര്‍, കൃഷിക്കാര്‍, നഗരവാസികള്‍, ധനാഢ്യര്‍ ഇവരെല്ലാം നേരിടുന്ന വിഷയമാണ്. മഴക്കാലം വരുന്നു. ജലത്തിന് കൂടുതല്‍ പ്രാധാന്യം നല്‍കുക. അങ്ങനെയാണെങ്കില്‍, ഇക്കൊല്ലം ദീപാവലി ആഘോഷിക്കുന്ന വേളയില്‍ നമ്മള്‍ എത്രമാത്രം വെള്ളം സംഭരിച്ചു എന്നോര്‍ത്ത് നമുക്ക് ആഹ്ലാദിക്കാം. നമ്മള്‍ എത്രമാത്രം ക്ഷീണിച്ചാലും മുഖത്ത് കുറച്ചു വെള്ളം തളിച്ചാല്‍ നമുക്ക് പഴയ ഊര്‍ജ്ജം വീണ്ടുകിട്ടും. അതാണ് ജലത്തിന്റെ ശക്തി. നമ്മള്‍ എത്രമാത്രം ക്ഷീണിച്ചാലും തടാകങ്ങളും സമുദ്രവും കാണുമ്പോള്‍ നമുടെ മനസ്സ് വിശാലമാകുന്നു. ഇതെല്ലാം ഈശ്വരന്‍ കനിഞ്ഞുതന്ന അമൂല്യഖനികളാണ്. മനസ്സുകൊണ്ട് അതുമായി താദാത്മ്യം പ്രാപിക്കാന്‍ കഴിയണം. ജലം സംരക്ഷിക്കണം, ആധുനികരീതിയിലുള്ള ജലസേചനം നടത്തണം. ഈ മഴക്കാലം നാം പാഴാക്കിക്കളയരുത്. വരുന്ന നാലു മാസക്കാലം ഓരോ തുള്ളി ജലവും സംരക്ഷിച്ച് മാറ്റിവയ്ക്കുക. ഇത് സര്‍ക്കാരിന്റെ മാത്രമോ, രാഷ്ട്രീയ നേതാക്കളുടെ മാത്രമോ കാര്യമല്ല. സാധാരണ ജനങ്ങളുടെയും കാര്യമാണ്. കഴിഞ്ഞ ദിവസങ്ങളില്‍ മാധ്യമങ്ങള്‍ ജലലഭ്യതയുടെ പ്രയാസങ്ങളെ കുറിച്ചായിരുന്നു പറഞ്ഞുവച്ചത്. മാധ്യമങ്ങള്‍ ജലസംരക്ഷണത്തിനായുള്ള മാര്‍ഗ്ഗദര്‍ശനങ്ങള്‍ നല്‍കട്ടെ, അതിനായുള്ള പ്രവര്‍ത്തനങ്ങളില്‍ വ്യാപൃതരാകട്ടെ. ജലക്ഷാമം പരിഹരിക്കുതിനുള്ള മാര്‍ഗ്ഗങ്ങളില്‍ മാധ്യമങ്ങളും പങ്കാളികളാകുമെന്ന് ഞാന്‍ വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു. ഞാന്‍ അവരെ അതിനായി ക്ഷണിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു.\nഎന്റെ പ്രിയപ്പെട്ട ദേശവാസികളേ, നമുക്ക് നവഭാരതം കെട്ടിപ്പടുക്കണം. ഒരു സുതാര്യ ഭാരതം ഉണ്ടാക്കണം. നമ്മുടെ പദ്ധതികള്‍ ഭാരതത്തിന്റെ എല്ലാ കോണുകളിലും സമാനരൂപത്തില്‍ ഏറ്റക്കുറച്ചിലുകള്‍ ഇല്ലാതെ എത്തിക്കണം. നമ്മുടെ പഴയ മനോഭാവങ്ങളില്‍ ചെറിയ മാറ്റങ്ങള്‍ വരുത്തണം. നിങ്ങള്‍ എന്നെ സഹായിച്ചാല്‍, നമുക്ക് ആ ദിശയിലേക്ക് വിജയപൂര്‍വ്വം മുന്നേറാന്‍ കഴിയുമെന്ന് ഞാന്‍ വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു. ഒരു വിഷയത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് ഞാന്‍ പറയുവാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. നമുക്ക് അറിയാവുന്നതാണ്, നമ്മള്‍ സ്‌കൂളില്‍ പഠിച്ചിട്ടുമുണ്ട്, നാണയങ്ങളും നോട്ടുകളും ഇല്ലാതിരുന്ന കാലത്ത് ‘ബാര്‍ട്ടര്‍ സമ്പ്രദായം’ നിലനിന്നിരുന്നുവെന്ന്. അതായത്, പച്ചക്കറികളാണ് ആവശ്യമെങ്കില്‍ അതിനു പകരമായി ഗോതമ്പ് നല്‍കണം. ഉപ്പ് വേണമെങ്കില്‍ അതിനു പകരമായി പച്ചക്കറികള്‍ നല്‍കണം. സാധനസാമഗ്രികളുടെ കൈമാറ്റവ്യവസ്ഥയിലൂടെയായിരുന്നു വാണിജ്യ ഇടപാടുകള്‍ നടത്തിയിരുന്നത്. ആ സ്ഥാനത്ത് പതിയെ പതിയെ പലതരം മുദ്രണങ്ങള്‍ വന്നുതുടങ്ങി. നാണയങ്ങളും നോട്ടുകളും തുട്ടുകളും വരാന്‍ തുടങ്ങി. എന്നാല്‍, ഇന്ന് സാഹചര്യങ്ങള്‍ പൂര്‍ണ്ണമായും മാറിമറിഞ്ഞിരിക്കുന്നു. ലോകം ഒന്നടങ്കം പണമില്ലാ സമൂഹമായി (cashless society) മുേന്നറുന്ന കാഴ്ചയാണ് കാണുന്നത്. ഇലക്‌ട്രോണിക് സാങ്കേതികവിദ്യയിലൂടെ ലോകത്തെവിടെനിന്നും പണം അയയ്ക്കുവാനും കൈപ്പറ്റുവാനും സാധ്യമാണ്. മാത്രമല്ല, ഏതൊരു സാധനവും ആവശ്യപ്പെടുവാനും ലഭ്യമാക്കുവാനും ബില്‍ അടയ്ക്കുവാനും കഴിയുന്ന സ്ഥിതി കൈവന്നിരിക്കുകയാണ്. മാത്രമല്ല, പേഴ്‌സിലെ പണം കളവുപോവുമെന്ന വേവലാതിയുമില്ല. എണ്ണിത്തിട്ടപ്പെടുത്തുന്നതിന് ഓട്ടോമാറ്റിക് സംവിധാനം ആയിക്കഴിഞ്ഞു. തുടക്കത്തില്‍ ചില ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടുകള്‍ അനുഭവപ്പെട്ടേയ്ക്കാം. എന്നാല്‍ ഒരു പ്രാവശ്യം പരിചിതമായിക്കഴിഞ്ഞാല്‍ ഈ സംവിധാനങ്ങള്‍ വളരെ എളുപ്പമുള്ളതായിമാറും. ഇതുകൊണ്ടുള്ള നേട്ടം പലതാണ്. ‘പ്രധാനമന്ത്രി ജന്‍ധന്‍ യോജന അഭിയാന്‍’ അതിവേഗം മുന്നോട്ടുകൊണ്ടുപോകുക മാത്രമല്ല, രാജ്യത്തെ ഏതാണ്ട് എല്ലാ കുടുംബങ്ങള്‍ക്കും ബാങ്ക് അക്കൗണ്ട് തുറക്കാനുമായി. മറ്റൊന്ന് എല്ലാവര്‍ക്കും ആധാര്‍ നമ്പറുമായിട്ടുണ്ട്. മൊബൈലാണെങ്കില്‍ രാജ്യത്തെ എല്ലാ സാധാരണക്കാരിലും സാധാരണക്കാരുടെയും കൈകളില്‍ എത്തിക്കഴിഞ്ഞു. അതുകൊണ്ടുതന്നെ ജന്‍ധനും ആധാറും മൊബൈലും ചേര്‍ന്ന് JAM, J.A.M. ഒത്തൊരുമിക്കുമ്പോള്‍ നമുക്ക് പണമില്ലാസമൂഹമെന്ന നിലയിലേയ്ക്ക് മുേന്നറാനാകും. നിങ്ങള്‍ ഒരുപക്ഷേ, കണ്ടിരിക്കാം. ‘ജന്‍ധന്‍’ അക്കൗണ്ടിനൊപ്പം ‘RUPAY CARD” നല്‍കി കഴിഞ്ഞിട്ടുണ്ട്. വരുംദിനങ്ങളില്‍ ഈ കാര്‍ഡ് ‘ക്രെഡിറ്റ് ഡെബിറ്റ് കാര്‍ഡ്’ എന്നീ നിലകളില്‍ പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്താനാകും. മാത്രമല്ല, ഈയിടെ വളരെ ചെറിയ ഒരു ഉപകരണം നമ്മുടെ ഇടയിലേയ്ക്ക് എത്തിയിരിക്കുകയാണ്. അതറിയപ്പെടുന്നത്. ‘Point of Sale’ P.O.S., POS അതിന്റെ സഹായത്തോടെ താങ്കളുടെ ആധാര്‍ നമ്പറോ, RUPAY കാര്‍ഡോ ഉപയോഗിച്ച് ആര്‍ക്കുവേണമെങ്കിലും പണം ഇടപാടു നടത്തുവാന്‍ സാധിക്കും. പോക്കറ്റില്‍ നിന്ന് പണം എടുക്കുകയോ, എണ്ണുകയോ യാതൊന്നിന്റെയും ആവശ്യം വരുകയില്ല. മാത്രമല്ല, എവിടെയും പണവുമായി പോകേണ്ടതായും വരില്ല. കേന്ദ്ര ഗവണ്‍മെന്റ് മുന്‍കൈയെടുത്തതിലൊന്ന് POSലൂടെ സുതാര്യമായ രീതിയില്‍ പണമിടപാട് എങ്ങിനെ നടത്താമെന്നതിലാണ്. മറ്റൊരു സുപ്രധാനമായ കാര്യംകൂടി കേന്ദ്ര ഗവണ്‍മെന്റ് തുടങ്ങിക്കഴിഞ്ഞു. അതാണ് ‘ബാങ്ക് ഓണ്‍ മൊബൈല്‍’ – Universal Payment Interface Banking Transaction – UPI ഇതുവഴി സ്ഥിരം സമ്പ്രദായങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് മാറ്റം വരുത്തുവാനുമാകും. താങ്കളുടെ മൊബൈല്‍ ഫോണിലൂടെ Money Transaction പണമിടപാട് എത് വളരെയേറെ എളുപ്പമാകും. സന്തോഷകരമായ ഒരു വസ്തുതയാണ് NPCI ഉം ബാങ്കും ഇതിനെ Mobile App ലൂടെ തുടക്കം കുറിക്കുവാനുള്ള ശ്രമത്തിലാണ്. ഒരുപക്ഷേ, ഇത് എളുപ്പത്തില്‍ സാധ്യമാവുകയാണെങ്കില്‍ RUPAY CARDs എല്ലായ്‌പ്പോഴും ഒപ്പംകൊണ്ടു നടക്കേണ്ട ആവശ്യമില്ല. നമ്മുടെ രാജ്യത്ത് ഏതാണ്ട് ഒന്നേകാല്‍ ലക്ഷം ബാങ്കിംഗ് കറസ്‌പോണ്ടന്റുമാരായി യുവാക്കളെ നിയോഗിച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞു. മാത്രമല്ല, പോസ്റ്റോഫീസുകളെയും ബാങ്കിംഗ് സേവനങ്ങള്‍ക്കായി സജീവമാക്കിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഞാന്‍ സൂചിപ്പിച്ച ബാങ്കിംഗ് സംവിധാനങ്ങളെ ഉപയോഗിക്കുവാന്‍ പഠിക്കുകയാണെങ്കില്‍ അത് ഒരു ശീലമാക്കി മാറ്റിയാല്‍ നമുക്ക് പിന്നെ കറന്‍സിയുടെ ആവശ്യംതന്നെ ഉണ്ടാവില്ല. നോട്ടുകെട്ടുകളുടെ ആവശ്യമുണ്ടാവില്ല. പൈസയ്ക്ക് ആവശ്യമുണ്ടാവില്ല. പണമിടപാടുകള്‍ നമുക്ക് സ്വയം ചെയ്യുവാനാകും. മാത്രമല്ല, ഇടപാടുകളില്‍ തികഞ്ഞ സുതാര്യതതന്നെയുണ്ടാകും. നിയമവിരുദ്ധ ഇടപാടുകള്‍ എേന്നയ്ക്കുമായി നിലയ്ക്കും. കള്ളപ്പണത്തിന്റെ സ്വാധീനം നന്നേ കുറയും. അതുകൊണ്ട്, എന്റെ ദേശവാസികളേ, എന്റെ ആഗ്രഹമാണ്- നമുക്ക് ഇതു തുടങ്ങാം. ഒരു പ്രാവശ്യം ആരംഭിക്കുകയാണെങ്കില്‍ വളരെ എളുപ്പത്തില്‍ നമുക്ക് മുന്നേറാനാവും. ഇന്നേക്ക് പത്തിരുപത് വര്‍ഷങ്ങള്‍ക്കു മുമ്പ് നമ്മളാരെങ്കിലും ചിന്തിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാകുമോ ഇത്രയേറെ മൊബൈല്‍ നമ്മുടെയൊക്കെ കൈകളില്‍ ഉണ്ടാകുമെന്ന്. വളരെ സാവകാശം മൊബൈലും നമ്മുടെ ജീവിതചര്യയുടെ ഭാഗമായി മാറി. ഇന്ന് അതിനെക്കൂടാതെ ജീവിക്കുക അസാധ്യമാണ്. അപ്രകാരം പണമില്ലാ സമൂഹമായി മാറട്ടെ. കാലവിളംബം കൂടാതെ അത് സംഭവിക്കുമെങ്കില്‍ നന്നായേനെ.\nഎന്റെ പ്രിയപ്പെട്ട ദേശവാസികളേ, പലപ്പോഴും ഒളിമ്പിക്‌സ് മത്സരം വരുമ്പോഴോ, കളി തുടങ്ങിക്കഴിയുമ്പോഴോ ഒക്കെ നാം തല പുണ്ണാക്കാറുണ്ട്. നാം സ്വര്‍ണ്ണ മെഡലിന് വളരെ പിന്നിലാകും. വെള്ളി കിട്ടിയെങ്കിലായി. ഓട് കൊണ്ട് അവസാനം തൃപ്തിപ്പെടേണ്ടിവരും. എന്നാല്‍, കായികരംഗത്ത് നമ്മുടെ മുന്നില്‍ വളരെയേറെ വെല്ലുവിളികള്‍ ഉണ്ടെന്നത് ശരിതന്നെ. പക്ഷേ, ദേശം മുഴുവന്‍ അതിനുള്ള അന്തരീക്ഷം ഒരുക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. അതിന് നാം എല്ലാവരും സജ്ജരാകണം. റിയോ ഒളിമ്പിക്‌സില്‍ പങ്കെടുക്കാന്‍ പോകുന്ന നമ്മുടെ കായികതാരങ്ങളെ പ്രോത്സാഹിപ്പിക്കുന്ന തരത്തില്‍ ഓരോരുത്തരും അവരവരുടെ രീതിയില്‍ ആത്മവീര്യവും ഉത്സാഹവും വര്‍ദ്ധിപ്പിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. നമുക്ക് ഏവര്‍ക്കും പങ്കാളികളാകാം. ചിലര്‍ക്ക് പ്രോത്സാഹനഗീതം രചിക്കാം, മറ്റു ചിലര്‍ക്ക് ഗെയിംസ് കാര്‍ട്ടൂണ്‍ വരയ്ക്കാം. വേറെ ചിലര്‍ക്ക് ആശംസാസന്ദേശം ചമയ്ക്കാം. ഇനിയും ചിലര്‍ക്ക് കായികമായി പ്രോത്സാഹനം നല്‍കുകയും ആവാം. എന്തുമാകട്ടെ, എങ്ങിനെയുമാകട്ടെ, നമ്മുടെ കായികതാരങ്ങള്‍ക്കുവേണ്ടി രാജ്യം മുഴുവനും ഉത്സാഹനിര്‍ഭരമായ ഒരു ആവേശജ്വരം പടര്‍ത്തുന്ന അന്തരീക്ഷം ഒരുക്കാം. ഫലം എന്തുതെന്നയുമാകട്ടെ, മത്സരം മത്സരം തന്നെ. ജയമോ പരാജയമോ ആകട്ടെ, മെഡല്‍ കിട്ടുകയോ, കിട്ടാതിരിക്കുകയോ ചെയ്യട്ടെ, എന്നാല്‍ ആവേശോജ്ജ്വലമായ ഒരു അന്തരീക്ഷം ആവശ്യമാണ്. ഞാന്‍ നിങ്ങളോട് ഇത് പറയുമ്പോള്‍ തന്നെ നമുടെ കായികമന്ത്രി ശ്രീ. സര്‍ബാനന്ദ് സോനോവാള്‍ എന്റെ മനസിനെ തൊട്ടുണര്‍ത്തിയ ഒരു കാര്യം കൂടി ഞാന്‍ നിങ്ങളുമായി പങ്കുവയ്ക്കാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുകയാണ്. കഴിഞ്ഞ ഒരാഴ്ചക്കാലം നാമെല്ലാവരും തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പ് ഫലം എന്താകും പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് അസമില്‍ ഫലം എന്താകും എന്ന ചിന്തയില്‍ വ്യാകുലരായിരുന്നു. സര്‍ബാനന്ദ് സോനോവാള്‍ജി സ്വയമേവ അസം തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പിന് നേതൃത്വം നല്‍കുകയായിരുന്നു. മാത്രമല്ല അദ്ദേഹം മുഖ്യമന്ത്രി സ്ഥാനാര്‍ത്ഥി കൂടിയായിരുന്നു. ഇതൊക്കെയാണെങ്കിലും അദ്ദേഹം കേന്ദ്ര സര്‍ക്കാറില്‍ കായികമന്ത്രിയെ പ്രധാനപ്പെട്ട ഉത്തരവാദിത്വത്തിലുമായിരുന്നു. എന്നാല്‍ ഇതിനിടിയില്‍ ഉത്തരവാദിത്വം നിറവേറ്റുന്നതില്‍ അദ്ദേഹം കാണിച്ച കാര്യക്ഷമത അത്യന്തം സന്തോഷത്തിന് ഇട നല്‍കുന്ന കാര്യമാണ്. അസം തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പിന്റെ ഫലപ്രഖ്യാപനത്തിന് മുമ്പ് തന്നെ മറ്റാരെയും അറിയിക്കാതെ അദ്ദേഹം പഞ്ചാബിലെ പട്യാലയില്‍ എത്തിച്ചേര്‍ന്നു. നേതാജി സുഭാഷ് നാഷണല്‍ ഇന്‍സ്റ്റിട്യൂട്ട് ഓഫ് സ്‌പോര്‍ട്‌സ് (എന്‍ഐഎസ്)ല്‍ ഒളിമ്പിക്‌സ് മത്സരത്തിന് പോകുന്ന കായിക താരങ്ങളുടെ പരിശീലനം അവിടെയാണ് നടക്കുന്നതെന്ന് നിങ്ങള്‍ക്കും അറിയുമല്ലോ. എല്ലാ കായിക താരങ്ങളും അവിടെയുണ്ട്. ആരേയും അറിയിക്കാതെ കായിക മന്ത്രി എത്തിയെന്നത് കായിക ലോകത്തെ ഏല്ലാവരെയും അത്ഭുതപ്പെടുത്തി. ഈ പ്രത്യേക സാഹചര്യത്തില്‍ ഇങ്ങനെയൊരു മന്ത്രി എത്തുമെന്നാരും പ്രതീക്ഷിച്ചതുമില്ല. കായിക താരങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് വേണ്ട സൗകര്യങ്ങള്‍, അവരുടെ ഭക്ഷണ കാര്യങ്ങള്‍, ആവശ്യത്തിന് പോഷകാഹാരം ലഭിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടോ, അവര്‍ക്ക് ആവശ്യത്തിന് പരിശീലകരുണ്ടോ, പരിശീലനത്തിന് വേണ്ട മെഷീനുകള്‍ യഥാവിധി പ്രവര്‍ത്തന ക്ഷമമാണോ എന്നു വേണ്ട വളരെ ചെറിയ കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ പോലും കടുകിട വിടാതെ സൂക്ഷ്മമായി അദ്ദേഹം നിരീക്ഷിച്ചു. ഓരോ കായിക താരത്തിന്റെയും കിടപ്പ് മുറികള്‍ അദ്ദേഹം സന്ദര്‍ശിച്ചു. കായിക താരങ്ങള്‍ ഓരോരുത്തരോടും ഒറ്റയ്ക്കും കൂട്ടായും സംസാരിച്ചു. സ്‌പോര്‍ട്‌സ് മാനേജ്‌മെന്റിനോടും പരീശീലകരോടും വെവ്വേറെ സംവദിച്ചു. മാത്രമല്ല കായിക താരങ്ങളോടൊപ്പം ഭക്ഷണവും കഴിച്ചു. തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പ് ഫലം വരാനിരിക്കേ, മുഖ്യമന്ത്രിയുടെ ഉത്തരവാദിത്വം ഏറ്റെടുക്കാനിരിക്കേ: ഇവയൊക്കെയുണ്ടായിട്ടും എന്റെ ഒരു സഹപ്രവര്‍ത്തകന്‍ കായിക മന്ത്രി എന്ന നിലയില്‍ കാണിച്ച ഉത്തരവാദിത്തബോധം എന്നെ വളരെയധികം സന്തുഷ്ടനാക്കി. നാം ഓരോരുത്തരും ഇത്തരത്തില്‍ കായിക രംഗത്തിന്റെ മഹത്വം മനസ്സിലാക്കുമെന്ന് എനിക്ക് വിശ്വാസമുണ്ട്. കായിക രംഗത്തുള്ളവരെ പ്രോത്സാഹിപ്പിക്കുക, നമ്മുടെ കായിക താരങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് പ്രോത്സാഹനമേകുക ഇത്തരം കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ ഓരോരുത്തര്‍ക്കും വലിയ ആത്മവീര്യവും ശക്തിയുമാണ് നല്‍കുന്നത്. നമ്മുടെ കളിക്കാര്‍ക്ക് മനസിലാകും 125 കോടി ജനങ്ങളും അവര്‍ക്ക് ഒപ്പമുണ്ടെ്. എങ്കില്‍ അവരുടെ ഉത്സാഹം വര്‍ദ്ധിക്കുക തന്നെ ചെയ്യും.\nപ്രിയപ്പെട്ട ദേശവാസികളെ, കഴിഞ്ഞവര്‍ഷം ഞാന്‍ ഫിഫ അണ്ടര്‍-17 വേള്‍ഡ് കപ്പിന്റെ കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ സംസാരിച്ചിരുന്നു. എനിക്ക് പലതരത്തിലുളള നിര്‍ദ്ദേശങ്ങളും രാജ്യമൊട്ടാകെ നിന്നും ലഭിച്ചിരുന്നു. മാത്രമല്ല ഇക്കാലത്ത് ഞാന്‍ കണ്ടത് ഫുട്‌ബോളിന്റെ ഒരു അന്തരീക്ഷം രാജ്യത്തുടനീളം അലയടിക്കുന്നതായിട്ടാണ്. പലരും മുന്‍കൈയെടുത്ത് തങ്ങളുടെ ടീം തന്നെ ഉണ്ടാക്കികൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയാണ്. വളരെയേറെപേര്‍ ചേര്‍ന്ന് കളിച്ചാലും ഇല്ലെങ്കിലും നമ്മുടെ രാജ്യത്തെ ആയിരക്കണക്കിന്, ലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് യുവാക്കള്‍ക്കിടയില്‍ കായിക മേഖലയോട് അത്യധികം താല്‍പര്യമുണ്ടായിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഞാന്‍ എന്റെ സ്വന്തം അനുഭവംകൊണ്ട് സാക്ഷ്യപ്പെടുത്തുകയാണ്. ക്രിക്കറ്റില്‍ ഭാരതജനതയുടെ അതിയായ താല്‍പര്യം നാം കണ്ടിട്ടുണ്ട്. എന്നാല്‍ ഫുട്‌ബോളിലും അത്ര തന്നെ താല്‍പര്യം ഉണ്ടെന്നുളളത് ഏറെ സന്തോഷകരമാണ്. അവര്‍ സ്വയം വിപുലവും ഭാസുരവുമായ ഒരു ഭാവിയിലേയ്ക്കാണ് വിരല്‍ ചൂണ്ടുന്നത്. അതുകൊണ്ട് റിയോ ഒളിമ്പിക്‌സിന് വേണ്ടി മാത്രമല്ല നമ്മുടെ എല്ലാ കായികതാരങ്ങളെയും ഇഷ്ടപ്പെട്ട് നാം സന്തോഷത്തിന്റെയും ഉത്സാഹത്തിന്റെയും അന്തരീക്ഷമാണ് വരുന്ന നാളുകളില്‍ ഒരുക്കേണ്ടത്. ഓരോന്നിനെയും ജയാപചയങ്ങളുടെ ഉരകല്ലില്‍ ഉരയ്ക്കാതെ സ്‌പോര്‍ട്‌സ്മാന്‍ സ്പിരിറ്റോടെ ഭാരതം ലോകത്തിന് മുന്നില്‍ സ്വന്തം മുദ്ര ചാര്‍ത്തണം.\nഎന്റെ പ്രിയപ്പെട്ട ദേശവാസികളോടുളള അപേക്ഷയായി കരുതി നമ്മുടെ കായിക രംഗത്തെ സുഹൃത്തുക്കള്‍ക്കായി ഉത്സാഹത്തിന്റെയും സന്തോഷത്തിന്റെയും ഒരു അന്തരീക്ഷം ഒരുക്കാന്‍ നമുക്കൊരുമിക്കാം.\nഎന്റെ പ്രിയദേശവാസികളെ, കഴിഞ്ഞ എട്ടുപത്ത് ദിവസങ്ങളിലായി പലയിടത്തുനിന്നും നല്ല റിസള്‍ട്ടുകള്‍ വന്നുകൊണ്ടിരുക്കുകയാണ്. ഞാന്‍ തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പിലെ റിസള്‍ട്ടിന്റെ കാര്യമല്ല പറയുന്നത്. വര്‍ഷം മുഴുവന്‍ കഠിനാദ്ധ്വാനം ചെയ്ത് 10ഉം 12ഉം ക്ലാസ്സുകളില്‍ പരീക്ഷയെഴുതിയ വിദ്യാര്‍ത്ഥികളുടെ റിസള്‍ട്ടുകള്‍ ഒന്നിന് പുറകെ ഒന്നായി വന്നുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയാണ്. നമ്മുടെ പെണ്‍കുട്ടികള്‍ ശക്തമായ പ്രകടനമാണ് കാഴ്ചവച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നത്. ഇത് അത്യന്തം സന്തോഷകരമായ കാര്യമാണ്. ഈ പരിശ്രമത്തില്‍ വിജയം നേടിയ എല്ലാപേര്‍ക്കും എന്റെ ശുഭാശംസകള്‍. ഞാന്‍ ഏവര്‍ക്കും മംഗളം നേരുന്നു. വിജയം നേടാന്‍ സാധിക്കാതെ വന്നവരോട് പറയുവാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുകയാണ് ജീവിതത്തില്‍ ചെയ്യുവാന്‍ വളരെയേറെയുണ്ട്. ഒരുപക്ഷേ, നാമാഗ്രഹിച്ച ഫലം ഉണ്ടായില്ലെങ്കില്‍ പോലും ജീവിതം ഒരിടത്തും വഴിമുട്ടി നില്‍ക്കില്ല. ആത്മവിശ്വാസത്തോടെ ജീവിക്കണം. വിശ്വാസത്തോടെ മുേറണം. വിജയം ഏവര്‍ക്കും സുനിശ്ചിതമാണ്. എന്നാല്‍ ഒരു വലിയ പുതിയ രീതിയിലുളള പ്രശ്‌നം എന്റെ മുമ്പില്‍ എത്തിയിരിക്കുകയാണ്. ഞാന്‍ ഇതുവരെ ഈ വിഷയത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് ചിന്തിച്ചിട്ടുപോലുമില്ലായിരുന്നു. എന്നാല്‍ എന്റെ മൈ ജി.ഒ.വി. ഡോട്ടിന്നില്‍ ഇ-മെയില്‍ വപ്പോഴാണ് ഞാനത് ശ്രദ്ധിച്ചത്. മധ്യപ്രദേശിലെ ഒരു മിസ്റ്റര്‍ ഗൗരവ്… ഗൗരവ് പട്ടേല്‍ അദ്ദേഹം തന്റെ ഒരു വലിയ ബുദ്ധിമുട്ട് എന്റെ മുമ്പില്‍ അവതരിപ്പിച്ചു. ഗൗരവ് പട്ടേല്‍ പറയുന്നത് മദ്ധ്യപ്രദേശിലെ ബോര്‍ഡ് പരീക്ഷയില്‍ തനിക്ക് 89.33 ശതമാനം ലഭിച്ചു. എന്നാല്‍ ഇത് വായിച്ചപ്പോള്‍ എനിക്ക് തോന്നി കൊളളാം. ഇത് എത്ര സന്തോഷകരമായ കാര്യമാണ്. എന്നാല്‍ അദ്ദേഹം തന്റെ ദുഖത്തിന്റെ കഥപറയുകാണ് പിന്നെ. ഗൗരവ് പട്ടേല്‍ പറയുന്നു സാര്‍ 89.33 ശതമാനം മാര്‍ക്ക് വാങ്ങി ഞാന്‍ വീട്ടിലെത്തിയപ്പോള്‍ വിചാരിച്ചു എല്ലായിടത്തുനിന്നും അനുമോദനങ്ങളും അഭിനന്ദനങ്ങളും ലഭിക്കുമെന്ന്. എന്നാല്‍ ഞാന്‍ അത്ഭുതപ്പെട്ടുപ്പോയി. വീട്ടിലെല്ലാവരും എന്നോട് പറഞ്ഞു 4 മാര്‍ക്ക് കൂടി കിട്ടിയിരുന്നുവെങ്കില്‍ നിനക്ക് 90 ശതമാനമാകുമായിരുന്നല്ലോ. അതായത് എന്റെ കുടുംബം എന്റെ സുഹൃത്തുക്കള്‍ എന്റെ അധ്യാപകര്‍ ആരും തന്നെ എന്റെ 89.33 ശതമാനം മാര്‍ക്കില്‍ സന്തുഷ്ടരായിരുന്നില്ല. എല്ലാവരും എന്നോട് പറയുന്നുണ്ടായിരുന്നു 4 മാര്‍ക്കിന്റെ കുറവില്‍ എന്റെ 90 ശതമാനം നഷ്ടപ്പെട്ടെന്ന്. ഇപ്പോള്‍ എനിക്ക് മനസിലാകുന്നില്ല ഇങ്ങനെയൊരു സ്ഥിതിവിശേഷം ഞാനെങ്ങനെ കൈകാര്യം ചെയ്യുമെന്ന്? ജീവിതത്തില്‍ ഇത് മാത്രമാണോ എല്ലാം. ഞാന്‍ ചെയ്തത് നന്നായിരുന്നില്ലേ. ഞാന്‍ അല്പം കുറഞ്ഞുപോയോ. എന്തെന്ന് അറിയില്ല എന്റെ മനസ്സില്‍ ഒരു ഭാരംകയറ്റിവച്ചതുപോലെ അനുഭവപ്പെട്ടു.\nഗൗരവ് നിങ്ങളുടെ കത്ത് ഞാന്‍ ശ്രദ്ധാപൂര്‍വ്വം വായിച്ചു. എനിക്ക് തോന്നുന്നു, ഒരുപക്ഷേ, ഈ വേദന നിങ്ങളുടെത് മാത്രമല്ല. നിങ്ങളെപ്പോലെ ലക്ഷകണക്കിന്, കോടിക്കണക്കിന് വിദ്യാര്‍ത്ഥികളുടെയുംകൂടിയാണ്. കാരണം, ഇങ്ങനെ ഒരു അന്തരീക്ഷമാണ് സംജാതമായിട്ടുളളത്. സംഭവിച്ചതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് സന്തോഷിക്കുന്നതിന് പകരം അതില്‍ അതൃപ്തി കണ്ടെത്തുക എന്നത് നിഷേധാത്മകതയുടെ മറ്റൊരു രൂപമാണ്. എല്ലാ കാര്യങ്ങളിലും അതൃപ്തി കണ്ടെത്തിക്കൊണ്ട് നമുക്ക് സമൂഹത്തെ സംതൃപ്തിയുടെയും സമാധാനത്തിന്റെ ദിശയിലേക്ക് നയിക്കാനാവുമോ. താങ്കളുടെ ബന്ധുക്കളും, സഹായികളും, സുഹൃത്തുക്കളും ഈ 89.33 ശതമാനത്തിനെ പ്രശംസിച്ചിരുന്നുവെങ്കില്‍ എത്ര നന്നായിരുന്നേനെ. എങ്കില്‍ താങ്കള്‍ക്ക് സ്വയമേ കൂടുതല്‍ എന്തെങ്കിലും ചെയ്യുന്നതിന് പ്രേരണ ലഭിച്ചേനെ. ഞാന്‍ രക്ഷകര്‍ത്താക്കളോട്, ചുറ്റുമുളള മറ്റുളളവരോട് പറയാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നത്. റിസള്‍ട്ടുമായി വരുന്ന നിങ്ങളുടെ കുട്ടികളെ സ്വീകരിക്കുക, സ്വാഗതം ചെയ്യുക. അവരോട് സന്തോഷം പ്രകടിപ്പിക്കുക. അവരെ ഇനിയും മുന്നോട്ടുപോകാന്‍ പ്രോത്സാഹിപ്പിക്കുക. അല്ല എങ്കില്‍ സംഭവിച്ചേയ്ക്കാവുന്നത് ഇതായിരിക്കും. 100 ശതമാനം ലഭിച്ചതിന് ശേഷവും നിങ്ങള്‍ പറയും 100 ശതമാനം കൊണ്ട് എന്ത് കാര്യം, എന്നാലും നീ കുറച്ചുകൂടി ചെയ്തിരുന്നുവെങ്കില്‍ നന്നായിരുന്നു എന്നു പറയുന്ന കാലവും വേന്നയ്ക്കാം. അതുകൊണ്ട് എല്ലാത്തിനും ഒരുപരിധിയൊക്കെവേണം.\nഎനിക്ക് ജോധ്പൂരില്‍ നിന്നും സന്തോഷ് ഗിരി ഗോസ്വാമി – അദ്ദേഹവും എഴുതിയിരിക്കുന്നത് ഏതാണ്ട് ഇതേ വിഷയം തെന്നയാണ്. അദ്ദേഹം പറയുന്നു എന്റെ അയല്‍പക്കത്തുളള ആള്‍ക്കാര്‍ ഞങ്ങളുടെ ഫലം അംഗീകരിക്കുന്നില്ല. അവര്‍ പറയുന്നത് കുറച്ചുകൂടി മെച്ചപ്പെട്ട രീതിയില്‍ ചെയ്തിരുന്നുവെങ്കില്‍ നന്നായിരുന്നേനെ എന്നാണ്. കുറച്ചുകൂടി മെച്ചപ്പെട്ടിരുന്നെങ്കില്‍- എനിക്ക് കവിത മുഴുവന്‍ ഓര്‍മ്മയില്ല എന്നാലും വളരെ മുമ്പ് ഞാന്‍ വായിച്ച ഏതോ ഒരു കവി എഴുതിയിരുന്നു ജീവിതത്തിന്റെ കാന്‍വാസില്‍ ഞാന്‍ വേദനയുടെ ചിത്രം വരച്ചു. അതൊരു പ്രദര്‍ശനത്തില്‍ വച്ചപ്പോള്‍ ഒരുപാട് പേര്‍ കാണാന്‍ വന്നു. എല്ലാവരും പറഞ്ഞു. ടച്ച്അപ്പ് വേണം. ചിലര്‍ പറഞ്ഞു നീലയ്ക്ക് പകരം മഞ്ഞയായിരുന്നെങ്കില്‍ നന്നായിരുന്നെന്ന്. ചിലര്‍ പറഞ്ഞു, ഈ രേഖ ഇവിടെ ഇടുന്നതിനു പകരം അവിടെയായിരുന്നെങ്കില്‍ നന്നാകുമായിരുന്നു. അതിരിക്കട്ടെ എന്റെ ഈ വേദനയുടെ ചിത്രം കണ്ടിട്ട് ഒന്ന് രണ്ട് പേരെങ്കിലും കണ്ണുനീര്‍ പൊഴിച്ചിരുന്നെങ്കില്‍ എത്ര നന്നായിരുന്നു. ഈ കവിതയുടെ വാക്കുകള്‍ ഇത് തന്നെയായിരുന്നോ എന്ന് എനിക്ക് ഇപ്പോള്‍ ഓര്‍മ്മയില്ല. വളരെ മുമ്പുളള കവിതയാണ്. എന്നാല്‍ അതിന്റെ ആശയം ഇതുതന്നെ ആയിരുന്നു. ആ ചിത്രത്തില്‍ നിന്നും ആര്‍ക്കും അതിലെ വേദന മനസ്സിലായില്ല. എല്ലാവരും ടച്ചപ്പിനെക്കുറിച്ചാണ് പറഞ്ഞുകൊണ്ടിരുന്നത്. ശ്രീ സന്തോഷ് ഗിരിജി താങ്കളുടെ ചിന്തയും അതുപോലെ തന്നെയാണ്. എത്ര ഗൗരവമുളളതാണിത്. താങ്കളെപ്പോലെ കോടിക്കണക്കിന് വിദ്യാര്‍ത്ഥികളും ഇത് പോലെ തന്നെയാണ്. ജനങ്ങളുടെ ആവശ്യങ്ങള്‍ നിറവേറ്റുന്ന കാര്യത്തില്‍ താങ്കളില്‍ സാമര്‍ത്ഥ്യമുണ്ടാകുന്നു. ഞാന്‍ താങ്കളോട് ഇത്രമാത്രം പറയാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. താങ്കള്‍ ഇങ്ങനെയൊരു അവസ്ഥയില്‍ സന്തുലനം നഷ്ടപ്പെടുത്തരുത്. ഓരോത്തരും ആവശ്യങ്ങള്‍ പ്രകടിപ്പിക്കുന്നു. അത് കേട്ടുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുക. എന്നാല്‍ സ്വന്തം നിലപാടില്‍ ഉറച്ചു നില്‍ക്കുകയും കുറച്ചു കൂടുതല്‍ ഭംഗിയായി നിറവേറ്റുന്നതിന് ശ്രമിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുക. എന്നാല്‍ നമുക്ക് ലഭ്യമായതില്‍ തൃപ്തരായില്ല എങ്കില്‍ പുതിയ ലക്ഷ്യം ഒരിക്കലും പൂര്‍ത്തികരിക്കാനാവില്ല. വിജയത്തിന്റെ ബലവത്തായ അടിത്തറ തന്നെയാണ് വലിയ വിജയങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് അടിസ്ഥാനമാകുന്നത്. വിജയത്തില്‍ നിന്ന് ഉടലെടുത്ത അതൃപ്തി വിജയത്തിന്റെ ചവിട്ടുപടികളാകുന്നില്ല. പിന്നെയോ അത് തോല്‍വിയുടെ ഉറപ്പായിത്തീരുന്നു. അതുകൊണ്ട് ഞാന്‍ നിങ്ങളില്‍ നിന്ന് പ്രതീക്ഷിക്കുന്നത് കിട്ടിയ വിജയത്തെ ഉരുവിട്ടുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുക. അതില്‍ നിന്നു തന്നെ പുതിയ വിജയത്തിനുളള സാധ്യതകള്‍ ഉടലെടുക്കും. എന്നാല്‍ ഞാന്‍ ഇക്കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് കൂടുതലായി അയല്‍വക്കത്തുളളവരോടും മാതാപിതാക്കളോടും സുഹൃത്തുകളോടുമായി പറയാന്‍ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നത്. നിങ്ങള്‍ നിങ്ങളുടെ കുട്ടികളുടെമേല്‍ ദയവായി നിങ്ങളുടെ ആഗ്രഹങ്ങള്‍ അടിച്ചേല്‍പ്പിക്കാതിരിക്കുക. സുഹൃത്തുക്കള്‍ എപ്പോഴെങ്കിലും ജീവിതത്തില്‍ പരാജയപ്പെട്ടാല്‍ ആ ജീവിതം അവിടെ നിലച്ചു പോകുമോ. ഒരാളെ എപ്പോഴെങ്കിലും പരീക്ഷയില്‍ നല്ല മാര്‍ക്ക് വാങ്ങിയില്ലെങ്കില്‍ അയാള്‍ സ്‌പോര്‍ട്‌സില്‍ വളരെ മുമ്പിലായി എന്നു വരാം. സംഗീതത്തില്‍ മുന്നിലായി എന്ന് വരാം. കലയിലും കരകൗശലത്തിലും മുന്നോട്ടുവന്ന എന്നു വരാം. വ്യാപാരത്തില്‍ മുന്നിലെത്തിയെന്നു വരാം. ഈശ്വരന്‍ എല്ലാവര്‍ക്കും എന്തെങ്കിലുമൊക്കെ സിദ്ധികള്‍ നല്‍കിയിട്ടുണ്ടാവും. അത് മാത്രം മതി. നിങ്ങള്‍ നിങ്ങളുടെ ഉളളിലെ ശക്തി തിരിച്ചറിയുക. അതില്‍ ഊന്നല്‍ നല്‍കുക. അത് ജീവിതത്തില്‍ എല്ലായിടത്തും സംഭവിക്കുന്നു.\nനിങ്ങള്‍ സന്തൂര്‍ എന്ന വാദ്യോപകരണത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് കേട്ടിട്ടുണ്ടാവും. സന്തൂര്‍ വാദ്യോപകരണം കശ്മീര്‍ താഴ്‌വരയില്‍ നാടോടി സംഗീതവുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടിരുന്ന ഒരു കാലമുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. എന്നാല്‍ പണ്ഡിറ്‌റ് ശിവകുമാര്‍ എന്നൊരാള്‍ അതില്‍ കൈവച്ചു. അതിനെ ലോകത്തിലെ തന്നെ മഹത്തായ വാദ്യോപകരണമായി തീര്‍ത്തു. ഷെഹനായി- നമ്മുടെ സംഗീത ലോകത്താകമാനം വളരെ പരിമിതമായ ഇടങ്ങളിലെ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നുളളൂ. കൂടുതലായും മഹാരാജാക്കാന്‍മാരുടെ ദര്‍ബാറുകളില്‍ അതിന്റെ കവാടത്തിലായിരുന്നു അതിന് ഇടം കിട്ടിയിരുന്നത്. എന്നാല്‍ ഉസ്താദ് ബിസ്മില്ലാഖാന്‍ ഷെഹനായില്‍ കൈവച്ചപ്പോള്‍ അത് ലോകാത്തരമായ വാദ്യോപകരണമായി മാറി. അതിന് പ്രത്യേക ഐഡന്റിറ്റി തന്നെ ഉണ്ടായി. അതുകൊണ്ട് നിങ്ങളുടെ പക്കല്‍ എന്തുണ്ട് എങ്ങനെയുണ്ട് എന്ന ചിന്ത വെടിയുക. അതില്‍ നിങ്ങള്‍ മുഴുകുക. മുഴുകി ചേരുക. അതിന് ഫലം ഉണ്ടാവുക തന്നെ ചെയ്യും. പ്രിയപ്പെട്ട എന്റെ ദേശവാസികളെ ചിലപ്പോഴൊക്കെ ഞാന്‍ കാണാറുണ്ട് നമ്മുടെ ദരിദ്ര കുടംബങ്ങള്‍ക്കും ആരോഗ്യപരമായ കാര്യങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് ചിലവാകുന്ന തുക അവരുടെ ജീവിതത്തിന്റെ പാളങ്ങളുടെ സമനില തെറ്റിക്കാറുള്ളത്. രോഗിയാവാതിരിക്കാന്‍ ചിലവ് വളരെ കുറവാണെന്നുളളത് ശരി തന്നെയാണ്. എന്നാല്‍ രോഗം വന്നാല്‍ ആരോഗ്യം വീണ്ടെടുക്കാനുളള ചിലവ് വളരെ കൂടുതലാണ്. നമുക്ക് രോഗം വരാതിരിക്കുകയും കുടുംബത്തിന് സാമ്പത്തിക ഭാരം ഉണ്ടാക്കുകയും ചെയ്യാത്ത ഒരു ജീവിതം എന്തുകൊണ്ട് ആയിക്കൂടാ. ഒരു കാര്യം, ശുചിത്വം രോഗത്തില്‍ നിുളള മോചനത്തിന് ഏറ്റവും വലിയ അടിസ്ഥാന ഘടകമാണ്. ദരിദ്രനെ ആര്‍ക്കെങ്കിലും സഹായിക്കാന്‍ കഴിയുമെങ്കില്‍ അത് ശുചിത്വത്തിനുമാത്രമാണ്.\nമറ്റൊന്ന് ഞാന്‍ തുടര്‍ച്ചയായി പറയാനാഗ്രഹിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നത് യോഗയെക്കുറിച്ചാണ്. ജൂണ്‍ 21 അന്താരാഷ്ട്ര യോഗാ ദിനമാണ്. ലോകത്ത് മുഴുവനും തന്നെ യോഗയോട് ഒരു പ്രത്യേക മമത വന്നിട്ടുണ്ട്. ആദരവും വിശ്വാസവും അതിന്‍മേലുണ്ട്. ലോകം ഇതിനെ സ്വീകരിച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞു. നമുക്ക് നമ്മുടെ പൂര്‍വ്വികര്‍ തന്ന അപൂര്‍വ്വ സമ്പത്താണിത്. ആ സമ്മാനമാണ് നാം ലോകത്തിന് നല്‍കിയിക്കുത്. പിരിമുറുക്കത്തില്‍ അടിപ്പെട്ട ലോകത്തിന് സന്തുലിതജീവിതം നയിക്കാനുളള ശക്തി യോഗ പ്രദാനം ചെയ്യുന്നു. മുന്‍കരുതലാണ് ചികിത്സയെക്കാള്‍ പ്രധാനം. യോഗയുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ട വ്യക്തിയുടെ ജീവിതത്തില്‍ അരോഗ്യമാണ് മുഖ്യം. സമചിത്തരായിരിക്കുക, ഉറച്ച ഇച്ഛാശക്തിയ്ക്ക് ഉടമയായിരിക്കുക. അതുല്യമായ ആത്മവിശ്വാസം നിറഞ്ഞ ജീവിതം നയിക്കുക, എല്ലാ കാര്യങ്ങളിലും ഏകാഗ്രത ഉണ്ടാവുക തുടങ്ങിയ സ്വാഭാവികമായ നേട്ടങ്ങള്‍ ഉണ്ടാക്കാന്‍ കാരണമാകുു. ജൂണ്‍ 21 -യോഗാദിനം. ഇത് വെറുമൊരു സൂചനാദിനമല്ല. ഇതിന്റെ വ്യാപ്തി വര്‍ദ്ധിപ്പിക്കണം. ഓരോ വ്യക്തിയുടെ ജീവിതത്തിലും അതിന് ഇടമുണ്ടായിരിക്കണം. ഓരോ വ്യക്തിയും തന്റെ ജീവിതചര്യയില്‍ 20-25 മിനിറ്റ് അല്ലങ്കില്‍ 30 മിനിറ്റ് യോഗയ്ക്കായി ചിലവഴിക്കണം. ഇതിനായി ജൂണ്‍ 21 യോഗ ദിനം നമുക്ക് പ്രചോദനം ഏകുന്നു. ചിലപ്പോഴെങ്കിലും സാമൂഹികമായ ഒരന്തരീക്ഷം വ്യക്തിയുടെ ജീവിതത്തില്‍ മാറ്റങ്ങള്‍ കൊണ്ടുവരുന്നതിനുളള കാരണമായി ഭവിക്കുന്നു. ഞാന്‍ ആശിക്കുന്നു ജൂണ്‍ 21 ന് നിങ്ങള്‍ എവിടെയായിരുന്നാലും നിങ്ങള്‍ മുന്‍കൈയെടുക്കുമെന്ന്. ഇനിയൊരു മാസം കൂടിയുണ്ട്. നിങ്ങള്‍ ഭാരത സര്‍ക്കാറിന്റെ വെബ്‌സൈറ്റ് സന്ദര്‍ശിക്കുക. യോഗയുടെ ഇത്തവണത്തെ സിലബസ് അതിലുണ്ട്. ഏതെല്ലാം ആസനമുറകള്‍ അനുഷ്ഠിക്കണം, എങ്ങനെ അനുഷ്ഠിക്കണം എന്നെല്ലാം അതില്‍ വിശദമായി പ്രതിപാദിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. അത് നോക്കുക. അത് അനുവര്‍ത്തിക്കുക. നിങ്ങളുടെ സമീപ പ്രദേശങ്ങളില്‍, നിങ്ങളുടെ പട്ടണത്തില്‍, ഗ്രാമങ്ങളില്‍, നിങ്ങളുടെ സ്‌കൂളില്‍, സ്ഥാപനങ്ങളില്‍, വേണ്ടിവന്നാല്‍ ഓഫീസില്‍ പോലും അത് അനുവര്‍ത്തിക്കുക. ഇപ്പോള്‍ മുതല്‍ ഒരു മാസം- തുടങ്ങുക, എന്നിട്ട് നോക്കുക. നിങ്ങള്‍ ജൂണ്‍ 21ന് ഇതില്‍ പങ്കാളിയായിരിക്കും. ഞാന്‍ പലയിടത്തും വായിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. പല ഓഫീസുകളിലും പതിവായി പ്രഭാതത്തില്‍ വന്നാലുടന്‍ സമൂഹയോഗയും പ്രണായാമവും അനുഷ്ഠിച്ചുവരുന്നുണ്ടെന്ന്. അങ്ങനെയുളള ഇടത്ത് ഓഫീസിന്റെ മുഴുവന്‍ കാര്യക്ഷമതയും വര്‍ദ്ധിക്കുന്നു. ഓഫീസിന്റെ മുഴുവന്‍ സംസ്‌കാരവും മാറുന്നു. ചുറ്റുപാടു തന്നെ മാറുന്നു. ജൂണ്‍ 21 നമുക്ക് നമുടെ ജീവിതത്തില്‍ യോഗയെ വരവേല്‍ക്കാനായി ഉപയോഗപ്പെടുത്താനാകുമോ, നമുടെ സാമൂഹ്യ ജീവിതത്തില്‍ യോഗയെ ഉപയോഗിക്കാനാകുമോ, നമ്മുടെ പരിസര പ്രദേശത്ത് യോഗയെ വരവേല്‍ക്കാനും ഉപയോഗിക്കാനുമാകുമോ.\nഞാന്‍ ഇത്തവണ ചണ്ഡിഗഡിലെ പരിപാടിയില്‍ പങ്കെടുക്കാന്‍ പോകുന്നുണ്ട്. ജൂണ്‍ 21 ന് ചണ്ഡിഗഡിലെ ആള്‍ക്കാരുമൊത്ത് ഞാനും യോഗ ചെയ്യുന്നുണ്ട്. നിങ്ങളും അന്നേദിവസം തീര്‍ച്ചയായും പങ്ക് ചേരണം. ലോകം മുഴുവനും ആ ദിവസം യോഗ അനുഷ്ഠിക്കുകയാണ്. നിങ്ങള്‍ ഒരു കാരണവശാലും പിന്നോട്ടു വലിയരുതെന്നാണ് എന്റെ ആഗ്രഹം. നിങ്ങള്‍ ഓരോരുത്തരും ആരോഗ്യവാന്‍മാരായിരിക്കേണ്ടത് ഭാരതത്തെ ആരോഗ്യമുളളതാക്കി തീര്‍ക്കുതിന് അത്യന്താപേക്ഷിതമാണ്.\nപ്രീയപ്പെട്ട എന്റെ ദേശവാസികളെ, മന്‍ കി ബാത്ത് എന്ന ഈ പരിപാടിയിലൂടെ ഞാന്‍ നിരന്തരം നിങ്ങളുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടു കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. വളരെ മുമ്പ് ഞാന്‍ നിങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് ഒരു മൊബൈല്‍ നമ്പര്‍ നല്‍കിയിരുന്നു. അതില്‍ മിസിഡ് കോള്‍ ചെയ്ത് നിങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് മന്‍ കി ബാത്ത് കേള്‍ക്കാന്‍ കഴിയുമായിരുന്നു. എന്നാല്‍ അത് കൂടുതല്‍ ലളിതമാക്കിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇനിയും മന്‍ കി ബാത്ത് കേള്‍ക്കുന്നതിന് നിങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് ഇപ്പോള്‍ കേവലം നാലക്കങ്ങള്‍ മാത്രം മതി. അതുവഴി മിസ്ഡ് കോള്‍ ചെയ്ത് മന്‍ കി ബാത്ത് ശ്രവിക്കാന്‍ കഴിയും. ആ നാല് അക്ക നമ്പര്‍ ഇതാണ.് 1922 ഈ നമ്പരില്‍ മിസ്ഡ് കോള്‍ ചെയ്താല്‍ നിങ്ങള്‍ എവിടെയായാലും എപ്പോഴായാലും ഏത് ഭാഷയിലും നിങ്ങള്‍ക്ക് മന്‍ കി ബാത്ത് കേള്‍ക്കാന്‍ കഴിയും.\nപ്രിയപ്പെട്ട എന്റെ ദേശവാസികളെ നിങ്ങള്‍ക്കെല്ലാം ഒരിക്കല്‍ കൂടി എന്റെ നമസ്‌കാരം. ഞാന്‍ പറഞ്ഞ ജലത്തിന്റെ കാര്യം മറക്കരുത്. ഓര്‍മ്മക്കില്ലേ? ശരി, നന്ദി, നമസ്‌കാരം.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

        "title": "पंतप्रधान नरेंद्र मोदी यांनी आकाशवाणीवरुन “मन की बात”द्वारे साधलेल्या संवादाचा मराठी अनुवाद, 22.05.2016",
        "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRsOiBeaPrI",
        "article": "\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, नमस्का. पुन्हा एकदा “मन की बात” करण्याची संधी मला मिळाली आहे. माझ्यासाठी मन की बात म्हणजे काही कर्मकांड नाही. मी स्वत: आपल्याशी संवाद साधायला उत्सुक असतो. आणि हिंदुस्थानच्या कानाकोपऱ्यातील, देशाच्या सर्वसामान्य नागरिकांपर्यंत “मन की बात” च्या माध्यमातून मी पोहचू शकतो याचा मला आनंद वाटतो. “मन की बात”चा प्रादेशिक भाषांमधला अनुवाद रात्री आठ वाजता प्रसारित करण्याचा आकाशवाणीने जो यशस्वी प्रयत्न केला आहे, त्यासाठी मी आकाशवाणीचे आभार मानतो. आणि याही गोष्टीचा मला आनंद वाटतो की, जे नागरिक माझा मन की बात कार्यक्रम ऐकतात, ते कार्यक्रमानंतर पत्राद्वारे दूरध्वनीच्या माध्यमातून तसेच “माय गोव्ह” या संकेतस्थळाच्या माध्यमातून आणि नरेंद्र मोदी ॲपद्वारे त्यांच्या भावना माझ्यापर्यंत पोहचवतात. आपण पाठवलेले सुचवलेले मुद्दे सरकार चालवतांना मला उपयोगी पडतात. लोक कल्याणासाठी शासन किती सक्रीय असायला हवे ? लोक कल्याणाच्या कामांना किती प्राधान्य दयायला हवे ? यासाठी, आपल्याबरोबर होणारा माझ संवाद, हे नाते फार महत्त्वाचे आहे. आपण अधिक सक्रीय होऊन, जनसहभागातून लोकशाही व्यवस्था कशी चालेल यावर अवश्य भर द्याल अशी मी अपेक्षा करतो.\nउन्हाळा वाढतच चालला आहे. असे वाटले होते की, त्यापासून थोडी सुटका होईल, पण तापमान वाढतच आहे. नैऋत्य मौसमी पाऊस बहुधा एक आठवडा उशीराने येईल अशी बातमीही मध्यंतरी आली. त्यामुळे चिंता अधिकच वाढली. देशाचा बराचसा भूभाग उष्णतेच्या लाटेने होरपळून निघतो आहे. तापमापकातील पारा जणू आकाशाला भिडला आहे. प्राणी असोत की पक्षी असोत, की माणसे सारेच या उन्हाळयाने त्रस्त आहेत. पर्यावरणाची काळजी न घेतल्यामुळेच या समस्या वाढत चालल्या आहे. जंगले कमी झाली, वृक्षतोड होत गेली आणि निसर्गाचा विध्वंस करुन जणू काही माणसाने आपल्याच विनाशाला, आत्मनाशाला वाट मोकळी करुन दिली.\n5 जून रोजी जागतिक पर्यावरण दिन आहे. जगभरात पर्यावरण या विषयावर चर्चा होतात, काळजी व्यक्त केली जाते. यावेळी पर्यावरण दिनाची मुख्य संकल्पना संयुक्त राष्ट्रांनी ठरवली आहे ती आहे “झिरो टॉलरन्स फॉर इल्‌लिगल वाईल्ड लाईफ ट्रेड” म्हणजे वन्यजीवांच्या व्यापाराला पूर्णपणे आळा” याबद्दल तर चर्चा होईलच पण आपल्याला झाडाबद्दलही बोलले पाहिजे, पाण्याबद्दल बोलले पाहिजे. जंगले कशी वाढतील याकडे लक्ष दिले पाहिजे.\nयाचे कारण म्हणजे आपण हे पाहिले असेल की, उत्तराखंड,हिमाचल, जम्मू-काश्मिर या भागातील हिमालय पायथ्याजवळच्या जंगलांमध्ये नुकताच भीषण वणवा लागला होता. या भीषण अग्नी प्रलयाचे मूळ कारण होते ते म्हणजे वाळलेला पालापाचोळा आणि थोडेसे दुर्लक्ष. परिणाम विनाशकारी वणवा. म्हणून जंगले वाचवणे, पाण्याची बचत करणे हे आपल्या सगळयांचे कर्तव्य ठरते, जबाबदारी ठरते.\nदुष्काळाची तीव्र झळ बसलेल्या 11 राज्यांमधील मुख्यमंत्र्यांशी काही दिवसांपूर्वीच सविस्तर चर्चा करण्याची संधी मला मिळाली. उत्तरप्रदेश, राजस्थान, गुजरात, महाराष्ट्र, मध्यप्रदेश, छत्तीसगड, झारखंड, कर्नाटक, आंध्रप्रदेश, तेलंगणा आणि ओडिशा ही ती राज्ये. तसे पाहल्या गेले तर शासकीय परंपरेप्रमाणे या सर्व राज्यांना एकत्रित मी घेऊ शकलो असतो. पण मी तसे केले नाही, प्रत्येक राज्याच्या मुख्यमंत्र्यांना मी स्वतंत्र भेटलो. प्रत्येक राज्याच्या मुख्यमंत्र्यांबरोबर सुमारे दोन-अडीच तास चर्चा केली. त्यांना काय सांगायचे आहे हे बारकाईने ऐकले. सर्वसाधारण पध्दतीनुसार भारत सरकारने, केंद्रशासनाने किती निधी दिला ? आणि किती खर्च झाला ? यापलिकडे फारशी चर्चा होत नाही. फार लक्ष दिले जात नाही.\nदुष्काळावर मात करण्यासाठी अनेक राज्यांनी केलेले उत्तम प्रयत्न पाहून केंद्र शासनाच्या अधिकाऱ्यांना अाश्चर्य वाटले. पाणी बचत, पर्यावरण संवर्धन, दुष्काळावर उपाययोजना, पशुधनाचे रक्षण, दुष्काळबाधित नागरिकांना आधार या सर्व मुद्दयांवर संपूर्ण देशभर त्या राज्यात सरकार कोणत्याही पक्षाचे असो, या समस्येवर मात करण्यासाठी दीर्घकालीन शाश्वत उपाय कोणते आखता येतील ? याकडे विशेष लक्ष दिले गेले आहे असे लक्षात आले. एक प्रकारे हा अनुभव मला काही शिकवणारा होता. ज्या आदर्श उपाययोजना असतील, जी आदर्श धोरणे असतील त्यांची सर्व राज्यांमध्ये अंमलबजावणी कशी करता येईल ? याकडे विशेष लक्ष द्यायला मी निती आयोगाला सांगितले आहे.\nकाही राज्यांनी विशेषत: आंध्र प्रदेश, गुजरात यांनी तंत्रज्ञानाचा भरपूर वापर केला आहे. राज्य सरकारांनी केलेल्या या यशस्वी उपाययोजना निती आयोगाच्या माध्यमातून देशाच्या इतर राज्यांमध्येही आपण पोहोचवायला हव्यात. अशा समस्यांवर मात करण्यासाठी लोकसहभाग हे यशाचे मुख्य कारण ठरते, मुख्य आधार ठरतो. आणि त्यात अचूक नियोजन, तंत्रज्ञानाचा योग्य वापर आणि निश्चित कालमर्यादेत उपाययोजनांची अंमलबजावणी करण्याचा प्रयत्न झाला तर त्याचे चांगले परिणाम मिळू शकतात असा मला भरवसा वाटतो.\nदुष्काळी परिस्थितीवर मात करण्यासाठी, जलसंवर्धनासाठी प्रत्येक थेंब वाचवण्यासाठी कारण पाणी म्हणजे परमेश्वराचा प्रसाद आहे, असे मी मानतो. आपण देवळात जातो, कोणीतरी आपल्या हातावर प्रसाद ठेवतो, त्या प्रसादातला थोडासा जरी आपल्या हातून सांडला तरी आपल्याला वाईट वाटते, तो पडलेला प्रसाद आपण उचलतो आणि परमेश्वराकडे क्षमा याचना करतो.\nपाणी म्हणजे ईश्वराचा प्रसादच आहे. एक थेंब जरी वाया गेला तरी आपल्याला दु:ख झाले पाहिजे. आणि म्हणून जलसंचय हेही तितकेच महत्त्वाचे आहे. पाण साठवण्याबरोबरच त्याचे संरक्षण करणे, ते वाचवणे महत्वाचे आहे आणि जलसिंचन हेही महत्त्वाचे आहे. आणि म्हणूनच पर ड्रॉप मोअर क्रॉप – प्रत्येक थेंब – अधिक उत्पादन, मायक्रो इरिगेशन – सूक्ष्म सिंचन, कमी पाण्यावर तयार होणारी पिके. अनेक राज्यांमध्ये ऊस उत्पादक शेतकरी आता ठिंबक सिंचनाचा, सूक्ष्म सिंचनाचा वापर करत आहे, ही आनंदाची गोष्ट आहे. काहीजण तुषार सिंचनाचा वापर करत आहेत. वेगवेगळया राज्यांच्या मुख्यमंत्र्यांची बैठक मी घेतली तेव्हा मला समजले की काही राज्यांनी भात शेतीसाठी तांदूळ पिकवण्यासाठी ठिंबक सिंचन प्रणालीचा यशस्वी वापर केला आहे आणि त्यामुळे त्यांना उत्पादनही अधिक मिळाले. पाण्याची बचत झाली आणि मजूरीचा खर्चही कमी आला. त्यांच्याकडून मला हेही कळले की बऱ्याच राज्यांसमोर मोठी उद्दिष्टे आहेत, विशेषत: महाराष्ट्र, आंध्र आणि गुजरात या तीन राज्यांनी ठिंबक सिंचनाच्या बाबतीत फार मोठे काम केले आहे. त्यांचा प्रयत्न आहे की, दरवर्षी, दोन-दोन, तीन-तीन लाख हेक्टर जमिन सूक्ष्म सिंचनाखाली आणायची. ही मोहिम सर्व राज्यांमध्ये राबवली गेली तर, शेतीला मोठा फायदा तर होईलच शिवाय पाण्याचे साठेही वाढतील. तेलंगणातील आमच्या बंधूनी मिशन भागिरथी या प्रकल्पाद्वारे गोदावरी आणि कृष्णा या नद्यांच्या पाण्याचा वापर उत्तम प्रकारे करण्याचा प्रयत्न केला आहे. आंध्र प्रदेशात निरु प्रगती मिशनच्या माध्यमातून, तंत्रज्ञानांच्या मदतीने भूजल पुनर्भरणाचा प्रयत्न सुरु आहे. महाराष्ट्रात जी लोकचळवळ उभी राहिली आहेत, त्यात लोक श्रमदानाबरोबरच आर्थिक मदतही देत आहे. “जलयुक्त शिवार अभियान” खरोखरच ही चळवळ महाराष्ट्राला भविष्यकालीन जलसंकटांपासून वाचवण्यासाठी उपयोगी पडेल असे मला निश्चितपणे वाटते आहे. छत्तीसगड राज्याने लोकसुराज्य-जलसुराज्य मोहिम हाती घेतली आहे. मध्यप्रदेशात बलराम तालाब योजना या उपक्रमातून 22,000 तळयांचे बांधकाम झाले आहे. ही संख्या लहान नाही. यावर काम सुरु आहे. त्यांची कपिलधारा कूपयोजना. उत्तरप्रदेशातले मुख्यमंत्री जलबचाव अभियान, कर्नाटकात कल्याणी योजनेतून विहीरी पुनरुज्जीवीत करण्याचे काम सुरु आहे. राजस्थन आणि गुजरात जिथे पुरातन कालव्यातल्या विहीरी आहेत त्या विहीरींना जलमंदिराच्या रुपाने पुनर्जिवीत करण्याचे मोठे अभियान हाती घेण्यात आले आहे.\nराजस्थानात मुख्यमंत्री जलस्वावलंबन मोहिम चालवली जात आहे. झारखंड हा वन्य प्रदेश. मात्र त्या राज्याच्या काही भागांमध्ये पाण्याची टंचाई आहे. तिथे चेकहॅम, छोटे बंधारे बांधून एक मोठे काम केले जात आहे. पाणी अडवण्याचे प्रयत्न सुरु आहेत. काही राज्यांमध्ये नदयांच्या पात्रातच छोटे छोटे बांध घालून दहा-दहा, वीस-वीस किलोमीटर क्षेत्रात पाणी अडवण्याची मोहिम हाती घेण्यात आली आहे. हा खरोखरच सुखद अनुभव आहे.\nमी देशवासिंयाना आवाहन करेन की येत्या जून, जुलै, ऑगस्ट आणि सप्टेंबर या महिन्यांमध्ये, पाण्याचा एकही थेंब वाया जाऊ देणार नाही असा आपण निर्धार करुया. आतापासूनच त्यासाठी व्यवस्था करुया. कुठे पाणी वाचवता येईल ? कुठे पाणी साठवता येईल ? हे ठरवूया, देव तर आपल्या गरजेप्रमाणे पाणी देतोच. निसर्ग आमच्या गरजा पूर्ण करतो. पण भरपूर पाणी आहे म्हणून आम्ही निष्काळजी रहिलो आणि पावसाळा संपल्यावर पाणी नाही म्हणून त्रस्त झालो तर हे कसे चालेल ? आणि पाणी हा विषय केवळ शेतकऱ्यांपुरता मर्यादित नाही. गाव, गरीब, मजूर, शेतकरी, शहरी, ग्रामीण, श्रीमंत-गरीब या सगळयांशी संबंधित हा विषय आहे. म्हणूनच आता पावसाळा येणार आहे तेव्हा पाणी हा आमचा प्राधान्याचा मुद्दा असायला हवा आणि यंदा जेव्हा आपण दिवाळी साजरी करु, त्यावेळी यंदाच्या पावसाळयात आपण किती पाणी वाचवले ? किती पाणी अडवले ? याचाही आनंद साजरा करु. आपण पहाल, आपला आनंद अनेकपटीने वाढेल. पाण्यात एक विलक्षण शक्ती आहे. आपण कितीही थकून आलो असलो आणि थोडेसेच पाणी चेहऱ्यावर शिंपडले तर किती ताजेतवाने वाटते. आपण कितीही दमलो असलो तरी विस्तीर्ण सरोवर, विस्तीर्ण समुद्र पाहून कसा विराटतेचा अनुभव आपल्याला येतो. परमात्म्याने दिलेला किती अनमोल खजिना आहे हा.\nआपले मन त्याच्याशी थोडे जुळवून घेऊन त्याचे संरक्षण करु. पाण्याचे संवर्धन करु आणि पाण्याचा साठाही करु. जलसिंचनाच्या बाबतीत आधुनिक होऊन. ही गोष्ट आज मी आपल्याला आवर्जुन सांगतो आहे. यंदाचा हंगाम हातून जाऊ देऊ नका. येणाऱ्या चार महिन्यांमध्ये प्रत्येक थेंब पाणी वाचवण्यासाठी अभियान हाती घ्यायचे आहे. आणि हे केवळ सरकारचे नाही, राजकीय नेत्याचे नाही, तर सर्वसामान्य माणसाचे काम आहे. पाणी संकंटाच्या बातम्या गेल्या काही दिवसात माध्यमातून विस्ताराने येत आहेत. पाणी वाचवण्यासाठी, मोहिम हाती घेण्यासाठी जनतेला मार्गदर्शन करण्याच्या बाबतीत आणि जलदुर्भिक्षापासून कायमची मुक्ती मिळवण्याच्या बाबतीत ही माध्यमे नागरिकांना मार्गदर्शन करतील आणि त्यांनी याकामी भागिदार व्हावे म्हणून मी माध्यमांना आमंत्रित करतो.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, आपल्याला आधुनिक भारताची निर्मिती करायची आहे. आपला भारत पारदर्शी घडवायचा आहे. अशा अनेक योजना, प्रणाली आहे. ज्या भारताच्या एका टोकापासून, दुसऱ्या टोकापर्यंत सारख्याच पध्दतीने पोहोचवायच्या आहेत. हे करण्यासाठी आपल्या जुन्या सवयी आपल्याला बदलाव्या लागतील. आज मी अशा एका विषयाला स्पर्श करु इच्छितो. ज्याबाबतीत आपण मला मदत केलीत तर त्या दिशेकडे आपण यशस्वीपणे जाऊ शकतो. आपल्याला सर्वांना ठाऊक आहे, आपण शाळेत हे शिकलो आहे. एक काळ असा होता, जेव्हा नाणी नव्हती, चलनी नोटा नव्हत्या. तेव्हा वस्तू विनिमय पध्दत होती, बार्टर सिस्टीम. तुम्हाला भाजी हवी असेल, तर त्याबदल्यात इतके गहू दया, तुम्हाला मीठ हवे असेल तर त्यासाठी इतकी भाजी द्या. वस्तूविनिमयातून व्यवहार होत असत.\nहळूहळू नाणी वापरात आली. चलन वापरात आले. नोटा वापरात आल्या. पण आता काळ बदलला आहे. सारे जग कॅशलेस सोसायटी म्हणजे रोकडविरहीत व्यवस्थेच्या दिशेने जात आहे. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक तंत्रज्ञानाच्या माध्यमातून आपण पैसे मिळवू शकतो आणि पैसे पाठवूही शकतो. वस्तूची खरेदी करु शकतो. देयक म्हणजे बिल चुकती करु शकतो. यात तुमच्या खिशातले पाकिट चोरीला जाण्याची भितीही उद्‌भवत नाही, हिशेब ठेवण्याची चिंता ही नाही. तो आपोआप नोंदवला जाईल. ही पध्दत वापरणे सुरुवातीला थोडे कठीण वाटेल मात्र एकदा सवयीचे झाल्यानंतर ही व्यवस्था सुलभ होईल. हे यासाठी शक्य आहे कारण गेल्या काही दिवसात आम्ही जी प्रधानमंत्री जनधन योजना राबविली, त्यात देशातील जवळजवळ सर्व कुटुंबांची बँक खाती उघडली गेली. दुसरीकडे आधार क्रमांकही मिळाला आणि मोबाईल तर आता भारतात जवळजवळ प्रत्येक भारतीयांच्या हातात आला आहे. म्हणूनच जनधन, आधार-मोबाईल-जॅम (जे.ए.एम.) यांचा ताळमेळ घालून आपण रोकडविरहित व्यवस्था, कॅशलेस सोसायटीच्या दिशेने पुढे जाऊ शकतो. आपण हे बघितले असेल की, जनधन खात्यासोबत रुपेकार्ड देण्यात आले आहे. येत्या काळात ते कार्ड क्रेडिट आणि डेबिट या दोन्ही वापरांसाठी उपयोगी ठरेल. आणि हल्ली तर एक लहानसे यंत्रही उपलब्ध झाले आहे. ज्याला पी.ओ.एस. पाँईट ऑफ सेल असे म्हटले जाते. या यंत्राच्या माध्यमातून तुम्ही आधार क्रमांक, रुपे कार्ड वापरुन इतरांची देणी देऊ शकता. खिशात रक्कम बाळगण्याची ती मोजायची आवश्यकताच नाही. भारत सरकारने जे उपक्रम हाती घेतले आहे त्यापैकी एक आहे पीओएसच्या माध्यमातून पैसे कसे देता येतील ?\nदुसरा उपक्रम आम्ही हातात घेतला आहे तो बँक ऑन मोबाईल. युर्निवर्सल पेमेंट इंटर फेस बँकिंग ट्रान्झॅक्शन. “युपीआय” पध्दत बदलणारी ही व्यवस्था ठरेल. तुमच्या मोबाईल फोनच्या माध्यमातून पैशाची देवाण-घेवाण करणे फार सोपे होऊन जाईल. आनंदाची गोष्ट म्हणजे एनपीसीआय आणि बँका ही व्यवस्था मोबाईल ॲपच्या माध्यमातून प्रत्यक्षात आणण्यासाठी काम करत आहे. आणि हे प्रत्यक्षात आले तर कदाचित रुपे कार्डसुध्दा जवळ बाळगण्याची आवश्यकता उरणार नाही. देशभरात सुमारे सव्वालाख तरुणांना बँक प्रतिनिधी म्हणून भरती करण्यात आले आहे. एकाप्रकारे बँक आपल्या दारी या दिशेने उचलले हे पाऊल आहे. पोस्टाच्या कार्यालयातही बँकेच्या सेवा मिळतील यासाठी हालचाली सुरु आहेत.\nया पध्दतीचा व्यवहारात वापर करायला आपण शिकलो, त्याची सवय केली तर प्रत्यक्ष चलनाची गरजच उरणार नाही, रक्कम खिशात घेण्याची गरजच उरणार नाही. व्यवहार आपोआप होत राहतील आणि त्यामुळे पारदर्शकता येईल. बेहिशेबी व्यवहार, दोन नंबरचे व्यवहार बंद होतील. काळया पैशाचा परिणामही कमी होईल. म्हणून मी देशवासियांना आवर्जुन सांगेन की, आपण याची सुरुवात करुया. आपण बघा, एकदा ही व्यवस्था सुरु झाली की, सहजसुलभ पध्दतीने आपण पुढे जाऊ. आजपासून वीस वर्षांपूर्वी कोणाला वाटले तरी होते का ? की, इतके मोबाईल आमच्या हातात असतील म्हणून. हळूहळू सवय झाली आता त्याच्याशिवाय राहणे शक्य नाही. हे शक्य आहे की, रोकडविरहीत व्यवस्था (कॅशलेस सोसायटी ) हळूहळू तशीच आकाराला येईल. पण हे कमी कालावधीत प्रत्यक्षात आले तर अधिक चांगले होईल.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, जेव्हा ऑलिम्पिक क्रीडा स्पर्धा सुरु होता तेव्हा आपण विचार करु लागतो की, सुवर्णपदकांच्या कमाईत आपण किती मागे राहिलो ? रौप्य पदक मिळाले की नाही मिळाले ? कास्य पदकावर समाधान मानावे की मानू नये ?हे खरे आहे की क्रीडा क्षेत्रात अनेक आव्हाने आमच्यासमोर आहेत पण देशभरात एक वातावरण निर्मिती व्हायला हवी. रिओ ऑलिम्पिंकमध्ये सहभागी होणाऱ्या आमच्या खेळाडूंना आपण प्रोत्साहन द्यायला हवे. त्यांचा आत्मविश्वास वाढायला हवा. आप-आपल्या पध्दतीने आपण हे करायला हवे. कुणी गाणे लिहावे, कुणी चित्र काढावे, कुणी शुभेच्छापर संदेश द्यावा, कुणी एखाद्या खेळाला प्रोत्साहित करावे, पण साऱ्या देशभरात असे सकारात्मक वातावरण तयार व्हायला हवे ज्यातून आमच्या खेळाडूंना प्रेरणा मिळेल. स्पर्धेचा निकाल काहीही लागो खेळ हा खेळ आहे. विजय मिळतोच तसाच पराभवही वाटयाला येतो. पदके हाती लागतात तशीच हातातून जातातही. पण आत्मविश्वास कमी पडता कामा नये. आम्ही हे आपल्याला सांगत असतांना आपले क्रीडा मंत्री श्रीमान सर्बानंद सोनोवाल यांनी केलेले एक काम माझ्या अंत:करणाला स्पर्श करुन गेले ते आपल्यापर्यंत पोहोचवतो.\nविधानसभा निवडणूकीचे निकाल काय असतील ? आसाममध्ये मतमोजणीचे आकडे काय असतील ? या विचारात आम्ही गेल्या आठवडयात होतो आणि श्रीमान सर्बानंद स्वत: आसाममधल्या निवडणूक मोहिमेचे प्रमुख होते. मुख्यमंत्री पदाचे उमेदवार होते. पण ते भारत सरकारचे मंत्रीही त्याचवेळी होते. आणि ही घटना मला जेव्हा समजली तेव्हा मला फार आनंद झाला. ती घटना अशी की आसाम विधानसभा निवडणूकीचे निकाल येण्यापूर्वी ते कुणालाही कळू न देता पटियाळा येथे पोहोचल. पंजाबमध्ये ऑलिम्पिक स्पर्धेसाठी जाणाऱ्या आमच्या खेळाडूंचे प्रशिक्षण तिथे होते. नेताजी सुभाष नॅशनल इन्स्टिटयूट ऑफ स्पोर्टर्स (एनआयएस), तिथे ते अचानक गेले. खेळाडूनांही आश्चर्य वाटले आणि क्रीडा क्षेत्रासाठी सुध्दा ही नवलाची गोष्ट होती की, एखादा मंत्री इतकी चिंता करतो खेळाडूंची काय व्यवस्था आहे ? त्यांच्या जेवणाची काय सोय आहे ? आवश्यकतेनुसार पोषक अन्न त्यांना मिळतेय की नाही ? त्यांच्या शारिरीक तंदुरुस्तीसाठी जे प्रशिक्षक असायला हवेत ते आहेत की नाही ? प्रशिक्षणासाठी वापरली जाणारी सर्व यंत्रसामुग्री कार्यरत आहे की नाही ? प्रत्येक गोष्ट त्यांनी बारकाईने बघितली आहे. प्रत्येक खेळाडूच्या खोलीची त्यांनी पाहणी केली आहे. खेळाडूंबरोबर, प्रशिक्षकांबरोबर त्यांनी संवाद साधला आहे. व्यवस्थापनातल्या अधिकाऱ्यांशी ते बोलले आहेत. सर्व खेळाडूंबरोबर ते स्वत: जेवले आहेत.\nनिवडणूकीचे निकाल लागणार असोत, मुख्यमंत्री म्हणून नवीन जबाबदारी सांगण्याची शक्यता असो माझे एक सहकारी अशा वातावरणातही क्रीडा मंत्री म्हणून आपल्या कामाबद्दल इतके जागृक आहेत हे पाहून मला आनंद झाला. आणि याचप्रकारे आपण खेळाचे महत्त्व समजून घेऊ असा मला विश्वास वाटतो. क्रीडा विश्वाला प्रोत्साहन देऊ या. आपल्या खेळाडूंना प्रोत्साहन देऊ या. जेव्हा सव्वाशेकोटी देशवासी आपल्यासोबत उभे आहेत हा विश्वास आमच्या खेळाडूंना वाटतो तेव्हा ही मोठी शक्ती ठरते आणि त्यांचा आत्मविश्वास दुणावतो.\nमागच्यावेळी मी फिफा अंडर सेव्हनटीन वर्ल्ड कपचा विषय काढला होता. देशभरातून मला त्याबद्दल सूचना प्रतिक्रिया आल्या आणि या काळात मला दिसतेय की, साऱ्या देशभरात फूटबॉलचे वातावरण तयार होऊ लागले आहे. अनेकजण पुढाकार घेऊन आपआपले संघ तयार करत आहे. नरेंद्र मोदी ॲपवर याबाबतीत अनेक सूचना मला मिळाल्या आहेत. हे शक्य आहे की, त्यांच्यापैकी अनेकजण खेळत नसतील, पण देशातल्या हजारो लाखो तरुणांच्या मनात खेळाबद्दल असलेली आवड हा माझ्यासाठी सुखद अनुभव होता. क्रिकेट आणि भारत यांच्यात असणारे नाते आपल्याला ठाऊक आहे. पण मी पाहिले की, फूटबॉलबद्दल इतकी आवड इतकी आस्था ? हे लक्षण भविष्यकाळातील सुखद संकेत म्हणावे लागेल. चला तर, रिओ ऑलिम्पिकमध्ये खेळणाऱ्या आमच्या सर्व खेळाडूंना प्रोत्साहन देण्याकरता एक चैतन्यमय वातावरण येणाऱ्या काळात तयार करुया. प्रत्येक गोष्ट विजय आणि पराजय अशा तराजूत मोजता कामा नये. खेळाडू वृत्तीसह भारताने जगात आपली ओळख निर्माण करावी. क्रीडा क्षेत्रासाठी संबंधित आपल्या सहकाऱ्यांसाठी उत्साहाचे चैतन्याचे वातावरण निर्माण करण्यासाठी आपणही काही करुया, असे आवाहन मी देशवासियांना करतो.\nगेल्या आठ-दहा दिवसांपासून कुठून ना कुठून तरी नवे नवे निकाल येत आहे. मी निवडणूक निकालांबद्दल बोलत नाही आहे, मी त्या विद्यार्थ्यांबद्दल बोलतोय ज्यांनी वर्षभर नेटाने अभ्यास करुन परिक्षा दिली. दहावी-बारावीचे निकाल एकामागोमाग एक येणे सुरु झाले आहे आणि आमच्या मुली पराक्रम गाजवत आहे हे तर आता स्पष्ट झाले आहे. आनंदाची गोष्ट आहे. ज्यांना या परिक्षांमध्ये यश मिळाले त्यांचे मी अभिनंदन करतो. त्यांना शुभेच्छा देतो. आणि जे अनुत्तीर्ण झाले, त्यांना सांगू इच्छितो की, आयुष्यात करण्यासारखे खूप काही असते आपल्या अपेक्षेनुसार निकाल लागला नाही म्हणून आयुष्य थांबत नाही विश्वासबरोबर घेऊन जगायला हवे. विश्वासाने पुढे जायला हवे.\nपण मला वेगळया नव्या प्रकारचा प्रश्न समोर आला आहे. आणि याबद्दल मी कधीसुध्दा विचार केला नव्हता. माझ्या “माय गोव्ह”वर एक ई-मेल आला तेव्हा त्याकडे माझे लक्ष गेले.\nमध्यप्रदेशात राहणारे श्रीमान गौरव पटेल यांनी त्यांची फार मोठी समस्या माझ्यासमोर मांडली आहे. ते म्हणतात की, मध्यप्रदेश बोर्डाच्या परिक्षेत त्यांना 89.33 टक्के गुण मिळाले. हे वाचून मला फार छान वाटले. आनंदाची बातमी आहे पण पुढे त्यांनी त्यांचे दु:ख मांडले आहे. ते म्हणतात, की, 89.33 टक्के मार्क मिळवून मी घरी गेलो तेव्हा मला वाटले होते की, चारही बाजूनी माझे कौतुक होईल, अभिनंदाचा वर्षाव होईल पण झाले भलतेच घरातले मला म्हणाले की, अरे चार गुण जास्त मिळाले असते तर 90 टक्के झाले असते. माझे कुटुंब माझे मित्र, माझे शिक्षक कुणालाही माझ्या 89.33 टक्के गुणांमुळे आनंद झाला नव्हता. आता ही परिस्थिती मी कशी हाताळू, हे मला समजत नाही. हे म्हणजेच सर्व आयुष्य आहे का ? मला जे गुण मिळाले ते चांगले नाही आहेत का ? मी कुठे कमी पडलो का कळत नाही ? पण माझ्या मनावर दडपण आल्यासारखे वाटते.\nगौरव, तुमचे पत्र मी बारकाईने वाचले मला वाटते की, ही वेदना तुमच्या एकटयाची नाही तर तुमच्यासारख्या लाखो-करोडो विद्यार्थ्यांची असू शकते. कारण वातावरणच असे तयार झाले आहे की, जे मिळाले त्यात आनंद मानण्यापेक्षा त्रुटी शोधायच्या. नकारात्मक वृत्तीचे हे दुसरे रुप आहे. प्रत्येक गोष्टीत उणीवा काढल्या समाधान मानलेच नाही तर समाजाला कधीच समाधानाच्या दिशेने नेऊ शकत नाही. तुमच्या कुटुंबियांनी, सहकाऱ्यांनी, मित्रांनी तुम्हाला मिळालेल्या उत्कृष्ट गुणांचे कौतुक करायला हवे होते म्हणजे आणखी काही करण्याचे बळ तुम्हाला मिळाले असते. मी आजूबाजुच्या लोकांना, पालकांना आवर्जुन सांगू इच्छितो की, तुमची मुले जो निकाल घेऊन येतील त्याचा स्विकार करा, स्वागत करा. त्या मुलांना पुढे जाण्यासाठी प्रोत्साहन द्या. अन्यथा असाही एक दिवस येईल की, तुम्हाला 100 टक्के गुण मिळतील आणि तरीही कुणी म्हणेल की, तुला शंभर टक्के गुण मिळाले हे खरे आहे पण तू अमूक-अमूक केले असते तर आणखी चांगले झाले असते. म्हणून प्रत्येक गोष्टीला एक मर्यादा असणे आवश्यक आहे.\nजोधपूरच्या संतोष गिरी गोस्वामी यांनीही अशाच अर्थाचे पत्र लिहिले आहे. ते म्हणतात की, त्यांच्या जवळचे लोक त्यांचा निकाल स्विकारायला तयार नाहीत. त्यांचे म्हणणे हेच की, आणखी काहीतरी चांगले करता आले असते, आणखी काहीतरी चांगले करता आले असते.\nमला ती कविता पूर्ण आठवत नाहीय पण खूप काळापूर्वी मी ती वाचली होती. कुण्या कविने लिहिले होते की, जीवनाच्या पटावर मी वेदनेचे चित्र काढले आणि त्याचे प्रदर्शन मांडले तेव्हा बघणारे म्हणाले यात सुधारणा हवी. कुणी म्हणाले निळयाऐवजी पिवळा वापरला असता तर बरे झाले असते. कुणी म्हणाले ही रेष इथे असती तर बरे झाले असते. अरे, अरे, माझ्या या वेदनेच्या चित्राला पाहून किमान एकाने तरी आसवे ढाळली असती तर ? असे त्या कवितेचे शब्द होते. मला आता नीट आठवत नाही. खूप आधीच्या काळात वाचलेली कविता. पण त्याचा अर्थ असाच होता. त्या चित्रातली वेदना कुणालाच कळली नाही. प्रत्येकजण सुधारणेबद्दल बोलत होता. संतोष गिरीजी तुम्ही व्यक्त केलेली चिंता अशीच आहे, जशी गौरव यांची आहे, तशीच आपल्या सारख्या करोडो विद्यार्थ्यांची असेल. लोकांच्या अपेक्षा पूर्ण करणे म्हणजे तुमच्यासाठी ओझे ठरु शकते.\nमी तर आपल्याला इतकेच सांगेन की, अशा अवस्थेत तुम्ही स्वत:चे संतुलन ढळू देऊ नका. प्रत्येकजण अपेक्षा व्यक्त करतो, ऐकून घ्या. आपल्या आपल्या निश्चियावर ठाम राहा आणि काही अधिक चांगले करण्याचा प्रयत्नही करीत राहा. पण जे प्राप्त झाले आहे त्यावर समाधान मानले नाही तर नवीन वास्तू कधीच उभारु शकणार नाही. यशाचा भक्कम पायाच, मोठया यशाचा आधार ठरतो. यशातून जन्माला येणारा असमाधानाचा भाव यशाकडे जाण्याची शिडी बनू शकत नाही. उलट अपयशाची ही हमी ठरते. आणि म्हणून मी आपल्याला आग्रहपूर्वक सांगेन की, जेवढे यश मिळाले आहे, त्या यशाचे गाणे गा. त्यातून नव्या यशाचे नवे मार्ग खुले होतील. हा मुद्दा मी शेजारी, आईवडिल आणि मित्रांना मुद्दाम सांगू इच्छितो की, तुमच्या अपेक्षा तुमच्या मुलांवर कृपया लादू नका आणि मित्रांनो, जीवनात कधी अपयश आले तर जीवन थांबते का ? ज्याला परिक्षेत चांगले गुण मिळत नाहीत तो खेळात पुढे जातो, संगीत क्षेत्रात पुढे जातो, कलाकुसरीच्या प्रांतात पुढे जातो, व्यापार व्यवसायात पुढे जातो. ईश्वराने प्रत्येकाला काहीना काही कौशल्य दिले आहे. बस्स तुम्ही तुमचे आंतरिक सामर्थ्य ओळखा, त्यावर भर द्या, जीवनात तुम्ही प्रगती कराल. आणि जीवन जगताना हा अनुभव प्रत्येक ठिकाणी येतो. संतुरवाद्याची आपल्याला माहिती असेल. एक काळ असा होता की, संतुर वाद्य काश्मिर खोऱ्यातील लोकसंगीताचे अभिन्न अंग होते. पण पंडित शिवकुमार ज्यांनी या वाद्याला हात लावला आणि आज जागतिक संगीत क्षेत्रात ते एक महत्त्वाचे वाद्य बनले. सनई – भारतीय संगीत क्षेत्रात सनई या वाद्याला मर्यादित वाव होता. राजा-महाराजांच्या काळात दरबाराच्या प्रवेशद्वारांपाशी सनईची जागा होती. पण उस्ताद बिसिमिल्ला खान यांनी हे वाद्य हातात घेतले आणि जगातील एक उत्तम वाद्य या उंचीवर सनईला नेऊन ठेवले. सनईची स्वतंत्र ओळख त्यांनी निर्माण केली. म्हणून तुमच्यापाशी काय आहे ? कसे आहे ? याची चिंता करु नका ? जे आहे त्यावर एकाग्र व्हा, एकचित्त व्हा. त्याचे फळ हे मिळाल्याशिवाय राहणार नाही.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, कधी-कधी माझ्या लक्षात येते की, आपल्या देशातील गरीब कुटुंबांत औषधांवर होणारा खर्च त्या कुटुंबाचा आर्थिक गाडा घसरणीला लावणारा ठरतो. आणि हे खरे आहे की, आजारी न पडण्यासाठी खर्च खूप कमी येतो. पण आजारी पडल्यानंतर पुन्हा आरोग्य पहिल्यासारखे व्हायला मात्र खूप खर्च येतो. आपण आपली जीवनशैली अशी का ठेऊ नये की, आपल्याला आजार शिवणारच नाही. कुटुंबांवर त्याचा आर्थिक भार पडणारच नाही. एक म्हणजे, स्वच्छता राखणे हा आजारापासून दूर राहण्याचा सर्वात महत्त्वाचा मार्ग आहे, आधार आहे. गरीबांची सर्वात मोठी सेवा कोणी करु शकत असेल ? तर ती आहे स्वच्छता. आणि दुसरे म्हणजे ज्यासाठी मी सतत आग्रह धरतो तो विषय म्हणजे योग. काहीजण त्याला योगा असेही म्हणतात. 21 जून हा आंतरराष्ट्रीय योग दिवस आहे. संपूर्ण जगभर योगाविषयी एक आकर्षण आहे, श्रध्दा आहे आणि जगाने त्याचा स्विकार केला आहे. आपल्या पूर्वजांनी आपल्याला दिलेली ही अनमोल भेट आहे, जी आपण जगाला दिली आहे. तणावग्रस्त जगाला संतुलित जीवन जगण्याचे बळ योगातून मिळते. प्रिव्हेनशन इज बेटर दॅन क्युअर, आजारी पडल्यावर उपाय करण्यापेक्षा आजार होऊच नये म्हणून काळजी घेणे उत्तम. योग विद्येशी जोडल्या गेलेल्या व्यक्तींसाठी निरोगी राहणे, संतुलित असणे, ठाम इच्छाशक्ती मनात निर्माण होणे, प्रत्येक कामात एकाग्रता साधणे या गोष्टी सहज शक्य होतात. 21 जून – योगदिन हा काही केवळ एक कार्यक्रम सोहळा नाही. योगाचा विस्तार व्हावा, प्रत्येक व्यक्तीच्या जीवनात योग विद्येचे स्थान असावे, प्रत्येक व्यक्ती आपल्या दैनंदिन आयुष्यातील 20 मिनिटे, 25 मिनिटे, 30 मिनिटे योगसाधनेसाठी देईल, यासाठी 21 जून हा योग दिन आम्हाला प्रेरणा देतो. आणि कधी कधी सामूहिक वातावरणामुळे व्यक्तीच्या जीवनात बदल घडू शकतो. मला आशा आहे येत्या 21 जूनला आपण याबाबतीत नक्की काहीतरी कराल. तुम्हाला पुढाकार घेण्यासाठी अजून एक महिन्याचा अवधी आहे. आपण भारत सरकारच्या संकेतस्थळाला भेट द्या, योग विद्येचा या वेळचा अभ्यासक्रम कोणता ? कोण-कोणती आसने करायची आहेत ? ती कशी करायची ? याची संपूर्ण माहिती त्या संकेत स्थळावर उपलब्ध आहे. ती माहिती पहा, आपल्या गावात, आपल्या गल्लीत, आपल्या शहरात त्याप्रमाणे करवून घ्या. आपल्या शाळेत, संस्थेत, अगदी कार्यालयातसुध्दा. अजुन एक महिना आपल्या हातात आहे. सुरुवात करा आणि पहा. 21 जून रोजी या उपक्रमाचा तुम्ही एक भाग व्हाल. मी अनेकदा वाचले आहे की, बऱ्याच कार्यालयांमध्ये रोज सकाळी नियमितपणे योगसाधाना केली जाते. सामूहिक प्राणायाम केला जातो. त्यामुळे संपूर्ण कार्यालयाची कार्यकुशलता वाढते. पूर्ण कार्यालयाची संस्कृती बदलते आणि वातावरणही बदलते. 21 जून या दिवसाचा उपयोग आपण आपल्या जीवनात योगविद्या यासाठी करु शकतो का ? आपल्या सामाजिक जीवनात योगशास्त्र असावे यासाठी करु शकतो का ? आपल्या अवतीभवती योगविद्येचा प्रसार व्हावा यासाठी करु शकतो का ? मी यावेळी चंदीगड येथे एका कार्यक्रमात सहभागी होणार आहे. 21 जून रोजी चंदीगडच्या नागरिकांबरोबर मी योगासन करणार आहे. आपणही त्यादिवशी सहभागी व्हा. सारे जग त्या दिवशी योगासने करणार आहे. आपण मागे राहू नका अशी माझी विनंती आहे. आपण निरोगी असणे हे भारताला निरोगी करण्यासाठी अत्यंत आवश्यक आहे.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, “मन की बात” माध्यमातून मी सतत तुमच्याशी जोडला जातो. अनेक दिवसांपूर्वी मी आपल्याला एक मोबाईल क्रमांक दिला होता. त्यावर मिस्ड कॉल देऊन आपण “मन की बात” ऐकू शकत होता. पण आता हे आणखी सोपे करण्यात आले आहे. आता “मन की बात” ऐकण्यासाठी फक्त चार आकडी क्रमाकांवर मिस्ड कॉल द्या. तो चार आकडी क्रमांक आहे एक नऊ दोन दोन, एकोणीसशे बावीस, वन नाईन टू टू. या नंबरवर मिस्ड कॉल देऊन “मन की बात” केव्हाही, कधीही, आपल्याला हव्या त्या भाषेत आपण ऐकू शकाल.\nमाझ्या देशवासियांनो, आपणा सर्वांना पुन्हा एकदा नमस्कार. पाण्याबद्दल मी सांगितलेले विसरु नका. लक्षात ठेवाल ना ? ठिक आहे. धन्यवाद. नमस्ते.\nB.Gokhale\n"

For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart.

I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"

పశ్చాత్తాపపడాలి. అందుక‌ని నీటిని నిల్వ చేయ‌డం, నీటిని పొదుపుగా వాడుకోవడం, సేద్యపు నీటిని సద్వినియోగించడం ఇవన్నీ కూడా సమ ప్రాధాన్యం ఇవ్వదగ్గవే. సూక్ష్మ సేద్యం పద్ధతిని అవలంబించడం ద్వారా, త‌క్కువ నీటిని మాత్రమే తీసుకొనే పంటలను సాగు చేయడం ద్వారా ‘ప్రతి చుక్క నీటితో ఎక్కువ పంట’ను అమలు చేయవలసిన అవసరం ఉంది. ఎన్నో రాష్ట్రాల్లో మ‌న చెర‌కు పండించే రైతులు సైతం సూక్ష్మ సేద్యపు నీటి పారుద‌ల ప‌ద్ధతులను అవ‌లంబిస్తున్నారన్నా, ఇంకొంత‌ మంది జల్లు సేద్య ప‌ద్ధ‌తిని పాటిస్తున్నారన్నా.. ఈ విషయాలు నిజంగా శుభ వార్త వంటివే. పదకొండు రాష్ట్రాల‌తో నేను చర్చ జరిపినప్పుడు కొన్ని రాష్ట్రాల్లో ధాన్యం పండించడానికి కూడా స‌మ‌ర్థంగా బిందు సేద్యం ప‌ద్ధ‌తిని విజయవంతంగా అమ‌లు చేశారన్న సంగతిని గమనించాను. దీని మూలంగా పంట దిగుబ‌డి అధికం అయింది. నీరు వృధా అవ‌లేదు. శ్రామికులపై పెట్టే ఖ‌ర్చు కూడా త‌గ్గింది. ఈ రాష్ట్రాలు చెప్పేదేమిటంటే – వారు పెద్ద‌పెద్ద అంచ‌నాలు వేసుకున్నారు. ముఖ్యంగా మ‌హారాష్ట్ర, ఆంధ్ర ఇంకా గుజ‌రాత్ ! ఈ మూడు రాష్ట్రాలు బిందు సేద్యంలో గొప్ప‌గా శ్ర‌మించాయి. ప్ర‌తి ఏడాది రెండేసి, మూడేసి హెక్టార్ల భూమిని సూక్ష్మ నీటిపారుద‌ల‌లోకి తీసుకురావాల‌న్న‌దే వాటి ధ్యేయం. ఈ మార్పు అన్ని రాష్ట్రాల‌లో తీసుకురాగ‌లిగితే వ్య‌వ‌సాయంలో ఎంతో లాభం పొంద‌గ‌లం. నీటిని దాచుకోగ‌లం. మ‌న తెలంగాణ రైతు సోద‌రులు ‘మిష‌న్ భ‌గీర‌థ’ ద్వారా కృష్ణా, గోదావ‌రి న‌దుల నీటిని స‌మ‌ర్థంగా ఉప‌యోగించుకునే ప్ర‌య‌త్నాలు చేస్తున్నారు. ఆంధ్ర‌ప్ర‌దేశ్‌లో ‘నీరు- ప్రగతి మిష‌న్’ ! అందులో కూడా భూగర్భ నీటి మట్టం పెంపునకు సాంకేతిక ప‌రిజ్ఞానం ఉప‌యోగం. భూగ‌ర్భ నీటిని పూర్తిగా వాడుకోవ‌డం కోసం చేసే ప్ర‌య‌త్నాలు. మ‌హారాష్ట్ర చేప‌ట్టిన ప్రజా ఆందోళ‌నలో ప్ర‌జ‌లు చెమ‌టోడుస్తున్నారు; ధ‌న స‌హాయం చేస్తున్నారు. వాళ్లు చేప‌ట్టిన ‘జ‌ల‌యుక్త శిబిర అభియాన్’ మహారాష్ట్ర‌ను భ‌విష్య‌త్‌లో క‌ష్టాలు రాకుండా కాపాడుతుంద‌న్న‌దే నా న‌మ్మ‌కం. ఛ‌త్తీస్‌గ‌ఢ్ ‘లోక సురాజ్ – జ‌ల సురాజ్’ అభియాన్ ను చేప‌ట్టింది. మ‌ధ్య‌ ప్ర‌దేశ్ ‘బ‌ల‌రాం తాలాబ్ యోజ‌న’ను అనుసరించింది.. దాదాపు 22 వేల చెరువులలో. ఇవేమీ మామూలు లెక్క‌లు కావు. వీట‌న్నింటి మీద ప‌నులు జ‌రుగుతున్నాయి. అలాగే ‘క‌పిల్ ధారా కూప్ యోజ‌న’ మ‌రి ఉత్త‌ర‌ప్ర‌దేశ్‌లో ‘ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి జ‌ల్‌ బ‌చావో యోజ‌న’ ! క‌ర్ణాట‌క‌లో బావుల‌ను తిరిగి బ‌తికించుకునేందుకు ‘క‌ల్యాణి యోజ‌న’ పేరుతో ప‌నులు మొద‌ల‌య్యాయి. రాజ‌స్థాన్‌, గుజ‌రాత్‌ ల‌లో – ఎక్కువ‌గా పాత బావులు ఉన్న ప్ర‌దేశాల్లో వాటిని నీటి దేవాల‌యాలుగా తిరిగి బ‌తికించుకునే ప్ర‌య‌త్నాలు సాగుతున్నాయి. రాజ‌స్థాన్‌లో ‘ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి జ‌ల – స్వావ‌లంబ‌న్ యోజ‌న’ ను చేప‌ట్టారు. ఝార్ ఖండ్ అట‌వీ ప్రాంతమే అయినా – కొన్ని కొన్ని చోట్ల నీటి ఎద్ద‌డి ఉంది. అక్క‌డ చెక్‌ డ్యాం పేరుతో పెద్ద ఆందోళ‌న చేప‌ట్టారు. వృథాగా పోయే నీటిని ఆపే ప్ర‌య‌త్నం ! కొన్ని రాష్ట్రాల్లో న‌దుల మీద చిన్న‌చిన్న ఆన‌క‌ట్ట‌లు క‌ట్టి 10 కిలోమీటర్ల నుండి 20 కిలోమీట‌ర్ల నీటిని ఆపే దిశ‌లో ప‌నులు చేప‌ట్టారు.\nఇదంతా ఒక అద్బుతమైన అనుభ‌వం. నేను ప్రజలకు ఒక విన్నపం చేస్తున్నాను.. రాబోయే జూన్‌, జులై, ఆగ‌స్టు, సెప్టెంబ‌ర్ నెలల్లో రండి- మ‌న‌మంతా ఒక్క‌నీటి చుక్క కూడా వృథా కానివ్వం అనే నిర్ణ‌యాన్ని తీసుకుందాం అంటూ. ఎక్క‌డెక్క‌డ నీటిని ర‌క్షించ‌గ‌లం..? ఎలా నీటిని ఆప‌గ‌లం. .? వీటి గురించి ఏర్పాట్లు చేద్దాం. మ‌న అవ‌స‌రాల‌కు త‌గ్గ‌ట్లు భ‌గ‌వంతుడు నీటిని అనుగ్ర‌హించాడు. ప్ర‌కృతి మ‌న అవ‌స‌రాల‌ను నెరవేరుస్తోంది. కానీ – మ‌నం ఒక‌వేళ నీటిని వృథాగా పోనిస్తే; ఇదే ప‌నిగా ఉంటే..? వ‌ర్షాకాలం ముగిసిన తరువాత నీరులేక‌పోతే అల్లాడిపోతాం? అప్పుడు ఎలా? నీటిని గురించి అంటే, ఒక్క రైతుల గురించే కాదండి. ప‌ల్లెవాసులు, పేద‌వారు, డ‌బ్బున్న‌వారు, కూలీలు, రైతులు, ప‌ట్న‌వాసులు, గ్రామీణులు అంద‌రికీ సంబంధించిన విష‌యం ఇది. వ‌ర్షాకాలం వ‌స్తోంది. మనకు నీరు కావాలి. అది లేనిదే, మ‌న‌కు మ‌నుగ‌డే లేదు. ఈసారి దీపావ‌ళి సంబ‌రాలు జ‌రుపుకునేట‌ప్పుడు ఎంత నీటిని దాచుకోగ‌లిగాం, ఎంత నీటిని వృథాకాకుండా ఆప‌గ‌లిగాం అనే విష‌యాన్ని సంతోషంగా చెప్పుకోగ‌ల‌గాలి. అప్పుడు మ‌న ఆనందానికి హ‌ద్దులంటూ ఉండ‌వు. నీటికి ఎంత శ‌క్తి ఉందంటే – మ‌నం ఎంత అలసిపోయి వ‌చ్చినా మొహం మీద ఇన్ని నీళ్లు చిల‌క‌రించుకున్నామ‌నుకోండి. ఫ్రెష్ అయిపోతాం. అంత శ‌క్తి ! బాగా అలిసిపోయినా, ఒక పెద్ద చెరువును చూసిన‌ప్పుడు.. లేదూ. అనంత‌మైన స‌ముద్రాన్ని చూసిన‌ప్పుడు- ఆ అనుభ‌వ‌మే గొప్ప‌గా ఉంటుంది. అవునా ! ఇంత అమూల్య‌మైన సంప‌దను దైవం ద్వారా మనం పొందాం. కాస్త మ‌న‌సు పెట్టి ఆ సంప‌ద‌ను కాపాడుకుందాం. నీటి వ‌న‌రుల్ని పెంచుకుందాం. నీటినీ పెంచుకుందాం. వాడిన నీటిని తిరిగి ఉప‌యోగంలోకి తెచ్చుకుందాం. ఈ విష‌యాన్ని మీకు నొక్కి చెబుతున్నాను. రాబోయే కాలాన్ని వృథాగా వ‌దిలివేయ‌కండి. ఆ నాలుగు నెల‌ల్నీ చుక్క‌చుక్క నీటిని కాపాడుకునేందుకు ‘జల్ బచావో అభియాన్ ‘గా మార్చుకుందాం. ఇది ప్ర‌భుత్వాల‌ది కాదు. మంత్రుల‌ది కాదు. మ‌న‌ది. మ‌న అంద‌రి బాధ్య‌త‌ ఇది. ప్ర‌చార‌ మాధ్యమాలు, ప్ర‌సార మాధ్య‌మాలు గ‌తంలో నీటి ఎద్ద‌డిని గురించి విస్తృతంగా వివ‌రించాయి. నీటిని కాపాడుకునే విష‌యంలో కూడా ఈ మాధ్య‌మాలు ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌కు మార్గ‌ద‌ర్శ‌నం కావాల‌ని, ఉద్య‌మాలు చేప‌ట్టాల‌ని, నీటి ఇబ్బంది నుంచి మ‌న‌ల్ని సంపూర్ణంగా త‌ప్పించే విష‌యంలో భాగ‌స్వాములు కావాల‌ని కోరుకుంటూ.. ఆ మాధ్య‌మాల‌ను కూడా నేను స్వాగ‌తిస్తున్నాను.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశ ప్రజలారా.. మ‌న దేశాన్ని మ‌నం ఆధునిక రంగంలోకి తీసుకువెళ్లాలి. మ‌న దేశం పార‌ద‌ర్శ‌కం కావాలి .ఎన్నో వ‌న‌రులు స‌మాన స్థాయిలో దేశంలోని అన్ని మూల‌ల‌కు చేరేట్టు చూడాలి. అందుకోసం.. మ‌న పాత అల‌వాట్ల‌ను కొంచెంగా మార్చుకోవాలి. ఒక్క విష‌యం గురించి ప్ర‌స్తావించ‌ద‌ల్చుకున్నాను. ఆ విష‌యంలో మీరు గ‌నుక నాకు స‌హాయ‌ప‌డిన‌ట్ల‌యితే ఆ దిశ‌లో త‌ప్ప‌కుండా మ‌నం అభివృద్ధిని సాధించ‌గ‌ల‌మ‌నే నా న‌మ్మ‌కం. మ‌నంద‌రికీ తెలుసు; చిన్న‌ప్పుడు చ‌దువుకున్నాం కూడా. ఒక‌ప్పుడు నాణేలు ఉండేవి కావు, నోట్లు ఉండేవి కావు. బార్ట‌ర్ సిస్ట‌మ్ న‌డిచేది. అంటే మీకు కూర‌లు కావాలంటే, దానికి బ‌దులుగా కొంత ధాన్యం ఇచ్చేవాళ్లు. ఉప్పు కావాలంటే, కూర‌లు ఇచ్చేవాళ్లు. ఒక వ‌స్తువుకు బ‌దులుగా ఇంకొక వ‌స్తువు. బార్ట‌ర్ సిస్ట‌మ్ అంటే ఇదే. మెల్ల‌మెల్ల‌గా నాణేలు, అదే ‘కాయిన్స్’ వ‌చ్చాయి, నోట్లు వ‌చ్చాయి. కానీ, కాలం మారింది. ప్ర‌పంచం న‌గ‌దు ర‌హిత వ్య‌వ‌స్థ వైపు ప‌రుగులు తీస్తోంది. ఎల‌క్ట్రానిక్ టెక్నాలజి ద్వారా మ‌నం డ‌బ్బులు తీసుకోగ‌లం, ఇవ్వ‌గ‌లం. దీనివ‌ల్ల జేబు నుంచి ప‌ర్స్ కాజేస్తార‌న్న భ‌య‌మే ఉండ‌దు. లెక్క‌లు రాసుకునే అవ‌స‌రం ఉండ‌దు. ఆటోమేటిక్ లెక్క‌లు ఉంటాయి. మొద‌ట్లో ఇది క‌ష్టంగా ఉంటుంది. కానీ నెమ్మది నెమ్మదిగా అల‌వాటు అయిపోతే.. ఈ వ్య‌వ‌స్థ సులువైపోతుంది. మేము ఈ మ‌ధ్య ప్ర‌వేశ‌పెట్టిన ‘ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి జ‌న్‌ ధ‌న్ యోజ‌న’ వ‌ల్ల దేశంలోని దాదాపు అన్ని కుటుంబాలు బ్యాంకులో ఖాతాలు తెరిచాయి. ఇంకొక వైపు ఆధార్ నంబ‌ర్ ల‌భించింది. ఇప్పుడు భార‌త‌దేశంలో ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క భార‌తీయుడి చేతిలో మొబైల్ ఉంది. ‘జ‌న్‌ ధ‌న్’, ‘ఆధార్’ మ‌రియు ‘మొబైల్’ – ‘JAM’ను జోడిస్తూ క్యాష్‌లెస్ సొసైటీ వైపు ముందుకు న‌డ‌వ‌వ‌చ్చు. జ‌న్‌ ధ‌న్ అకౌంట్‌తో పాటు.. రూపే కార్డు ఇవ్వ‌బ‌డింది. వ‌చ్చేరోజుల్లో ఈ కార్డు క్రెడిట్ మ‌రియు డెబిట్ – రెండు విధాలుగా ప‌నికొస్తుంది. ఈ మ‌ధ్య ఒక చిన్న ఇన్‌స్ట్రుమెంట్ వ‌చ్చింది. దానిపేరు ‘పాయింట్ ఆఫ్ సేల్’ – POS‌. మీ ఆధార్ నంబ‌ర్‌, రూపే కార్డు సాయంతో ఎవ‌రికైనా డ‌బ్బులు చెల్లించగ‌ల‌రు. జేబులో నుండి డ‌బ్బులు తీసి, లెక్క‌పెట్ట‌న‌వ‌స‌రం లేదు. డ‌బ్బును మోసుకుంటూ తిర‌గ‌న‌క్కర లేదు. కేంద్ర‌ ప్ర‌భుత్వం కొన్ని చొర‌వలు తీసుకుంటోంది. అందులో ఒక‌టి POS ద్వారా చెల్లింపు ఎలా చేయాలి? డ‌బ్బులు ఎలా తీసుకోవాలి? అన్న‌ది. మేము మొద‌లుపెట్టిన రెండో ప‌ని ‘బ్యాంక్ ఆన్ మొబైల్ – యూనివ‌ర్స‌ల్ పేమెంట్ ఇంట‌ర్‌ఫేస్ బ్యాంకింగ్ ట్రాన్‌సాక్ష‌న్స్‌-UPI విధానాన్ని మార్చేస్తుంది. మొబైల్ ఫోన్ ద్వారా మ‌నీ ట్రాన్‌సాక్ష‌న్ చేయ‌డం సుల‌భ‌మైపోతుంది. సంతోష‌క‌ర‌మైన విష‌యం ఏమిటంటే, NPCI మ‌రియు బ్యాంకులు ఈ ప్లాట్‌ఫాంను మొబైల్ యాప్ ద్వారా ప్రారంభించే దిశ‌గా కసరత్తు చేస్తున్నాయి. ఒక‌వేళ ఇది క‌నుక జ‌రిగితే, బ‌హుశా మీకు రూపే కార్డును మీతో కూడా అట్టిపెట్టుకునే పని ఉండ‌దు. దేశ‌వ్యాప్తంగా సుమారు 1.25 ల‌క్ష‌ల బ్యాంకింగ్ క‌రెస్పాండెంట్లుగా న‌వ‌యువ‌కుల‌కు భ‌ర్తీ చేయ‌డం జ‌రుగుతున్న‌ది. ఒక‌ర‌కంగా బ్యాంకు మీ గుమ్మం ముందుకు వ‌చ్చే దిశ‌లో ప‌నిచేస్తున్న‌ది. పోస్టాఫీసును కూడా బ్యాంకింగ్ సేవ‌ల కోసం ప్రోత్స‌హించ‌డం జ‌రుగుతున్న‌ది. ఒక‌వేళ మ‌నం ఈ వ్య‌వ‌స్థ‌ను వినియోగించుకోవ‌డం నేర్చుకున్నామంటే, మ‌న‌కు క‌రెన్సీ అవ‌స‌రం ఉండ‌దు; నోట్ల అవ‌స‌రం ఉండ‌దు; డ‌బ్బుల అవ‌స‌రం ఉండ‌దు. వ్యాపారం దానంత‌ట అదే న‌డుస్తుంది. తత్ఫలితంగా పార‌ద‌ర్శ‌క‌త చోటు చేసుకొంటుంది. రెండో ర‌కం లావాదేవీలు ఆగిపోతాయి. న‌ల్ల‌ ధ‌నం ప్ర‌భావం త‌గ్గిపోతుంది. అందుకే నేను దేశ ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌ను దీనిని మొద‌లుపెట్ట‌వలసిందిగా కోరుతున్నాను. ఒక్క‌సారి మొదలుపెడితే నెమ్మది నెమ్మదిగా, సులభంగా ముందుకు వెళ్ల‌గ‌లం. 30 సంవ‌త్స‌రాల క్రితం మ‌న చేతిలో మొబైల్ ఉంటుంద‌ని మ‌నం ఊహించామా..? మెల్లగా అది అల‌వాటైపోయింది. ఇప్పుడు మొబైల్ లేకుండా ఉండమంటే, ఉండ‌లేం. ఈ న‌గ‌దు ర‌హిత స‌మాజం కూడా అలాంటి రూపాన్నే ధ‌రించ‌వ‌చ్చు. కానీ అది ఎంత త్వరగా జ‌రిగితే, అంత బాగుంటుంది.\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ ప్ర‌జ‌లారా.. ఒలింపిక్స్ మొదలైన‌ప్పుడు మ‌నం త‌ల‌ ప‌ట్టుకుని కూర్చుంటాం. మ‌న‌కు బంగారు పతకం ద‌క్క‌లేదు. రజతం వ‌చ్చిందా.. లేదా కాంస్యంతో సరిపెట్టుకుందామా అనే ఆలోచనే ఉంటుంది. ఈ క్రీడ‌ల‌లో మ‌న‌ ముందు సవాళ్లు ఉన్నాయి. కానీ మ‌నం ఒక మంచి వాతావ‌ర‌ణాన్ని త‌యారు చేయాలి. రియో ఒలింపిక్స్ కు వెళ్లే క్రీడాకారులను ప్రోత్స‌హించ‌డానికి, వారి ప‌ట్టుద‌ల‌ని రెండింతలు చేయ‌డానికి ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రు త‌మ‌ త‌మ‌ పద్ధతులలో; కొంద‌రు కార్టూన్స్ ను గీసి, శుభాకాంక్ష‌లు తెలియజేస్తారు. ఎవ‌రు ఏ క్రీడ‌ను ప్రోత్స‌హించినా.. దేశ‌ ప్ర‌జ‌లు ఈ క్రీడాకారుల ప‌ట్ల సానుకూల వాతావ‌ర‌ణాన్ని త‌యారు చేయాలి. ఆట ఆటే. ఇందులో గెలుపూ ఉంటుంది. ఓట‌మీ ఉంటుంది. పతకాలు వ‌స్తాయి. ఒక్కొక్క‌సారి రావు కూడా. కానీ గ‌ట్టి ప‌ట్టుద‌ల ఉండాలి. ఈ విష‌యంలో మ‌న క్రీడా మంత్రి శ్రీ స‌ర్బానంద్ సోనోవాల్ చేసిన ఒక ప‌ని నా మ‌న‌సుకు హ‌త్తుకుపోయింది. దానిని మీకు వెల్లడించాల‌నుకుంటున్నాను. మేమంతా గ‌త‌ వారం ఎన్నిక‌ల హ‌డావుడిలో ఉన్నాం. ఎన్నిక‌ల ఫ‌లితాలు ఎలా ఉంటాయో.. అస‌లేం జ‌రుగుతుందో అని చూస్తున్నాం. స‌ర్బానంద్ గారు స్వ‌యంగా అస్సాం ఎన్నిక‌ల్లో ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి ప‌ద‌వికి పోటీ ప‌డుతున్నారు. కానీ వారు అప్ప‌టికే కేంద్ర‌ ప్ర‌భుత్వంలో మంత్రి. నాకు ఈ విష‌యం తెలిసి చాలా సంతోషం అనిపించింది. వారు అస్సాం ఎన్నిక‌ల ఫ‌లితాల‌కు ముందు ఎవ్వ‌రికీ చెప్ప‌కుండా ప‌టియాలా చేరుకున్నారు. నేతాజీ సుభాష్ నేష‌న‌ల్ ఇన్ స్టిట్యూట్ ఆఫ్ స్పోర్ట్స్ – NIS లో ఒలింపిక్స్ కు వెళ్లే ఆట‌గాళ్లు శిక్షణ పొందుతున్న సంగ‌తి అంద‌రికీ తెలిసిందే. వారు అక‌స్మాత్తుగా అక్క‌డికి చేరుకోవ‌డం అక్క‌డ ఉన్న క్రీడాకారుల‌ను ఆశ్చ‌ర్య‌ప‌రిచింది. ఇది క్రీడా జ‌గ‌త్తునే అచ్చెరువుకు గురిచేసే విష‌యం. ఒక మంత్రి ఈ విధంగా క్రీడాకారుల గురించి ఆలోచించడం, క్రీడాకారుల‌కు ఎలాంటి సౌక‌ర్యాలు ఇవ్వ‌బ‌డ్డాయి..?, భోజ‌నం ఎలా ఉంది..?, వారి శ‌రీరానికి అవ‌స‌ర‌మైన పౌష్టికాహారం అంద‌జేయ‌బ‌డుతున్న‌దా.. లేదా..? స‌రైన శిక్షకులు ఉన్నారా.. లేదా..? శిక్ష‌ణకు కావ‌ల‌సిన ప‌రిక‌రాలు స‌రిగ్గా ప‌నిచేస్తున్నాయా.. లేదా..? అన్న విష‌యాలను క్షుణ్ణంగా ప‌రిశీలించారు. ఒక్కొక్క క్రీడాకారుడి గ‌దిలోకి వెళ్లి చూశారు. క్రీడాకారుల‌తో క‌లసి భోజ‌నం చేశారు. ఎన్నిక‌ల ఫలితాలు వ‌స్తున్నాయి.. ముఖ్య‌మంత్రిగా కొత్త బాధ్య‌త‌లు స్వీక‌రించాలి; కానీ, నా ఒక స్నేహితుడొకరు క్రీడా మంత్రిగా త‌మ కర్తవ్యం పట్ల ఇంతగా ఆలోచించ‌డం నాకు ఆనందాన్ని క‌ల‌గ‌జేసింది. ఇదే విధంగా మ‌నం క్రీడ‌ల యొక్క ప్రాముఖ్య‌త‌ను తెలుసుకుంటామ‌ని నా పూర్తి న‌మ్మ‌కం. క్రీడా జ‌గత్తులో ఉన్న‌వారిని ప్రోత్స‌హిద్దాం, క్రీడాకారుల‌ను ప్రోత్స‌హిద్దాం. ఇది వారికి అతి పెద్ద బ‌లంగా మారుతుంది. 125 కోట్ల మంది ప్ర‌జ‌లు త‌మతో ఉన్నార‌ని క్రీడాకారుడికి తెలిసిన‌ప్పుడు ఆ ఉత్సాహం ద్విగుణీకృతం అవుతుంది.\nపోయిన‌సారి నేను ఎఫ్ఐఎఫ్ఎ అండ‌ర్‌-17 వ‌ర‌ల్డ్‌క‌ప్ గురించి మాట్లాడాను. దేశం న‌లుమూల‌ల నుంచి నాకు చాలా స‌ల‌హాలు అందాయి. ఈ మ‌ధ్య నేను చూసిందేమిటంటే ఫుట్‌బాల్ యొక్క వాతావ‌ర‌ణం దేశ‌మంతటా క‌న‌ప‌డుతోంది. చాలా మంది చొర‌వ తీసుకుని త‌మ‌ త‌మ జ‌ట్ల‌ను త‌యారు చేస్తున్నారు. NarendraModi Mobile App ద్వారా నాకు చాలా స‌ల‌హాలు అందాయి. చాలామంది ఆట‌లు ఆడ‌రు. కానీ వేల‌ కోట్ల ప్ర‌జ‌లు ఈ క్రీడ‌ల ప‌ట్ల ఆస‌క్తి చూపుతున్నారు. ఈ విష‌యం నాకు చాలా ఆనందాన్ని ఇస్తున్న‌ది. క్రికెట్‌తో మ‌న దేశానికున్న అనుబంధం గురించి అంద‌రికీ తెలిసిందే. కానీ ఫుట్‌బాల్ ప‌ట్ల కూడా ఈ మ‌క్కువ మంచి భ‌విష్య‌త్తుకు శుభ‌ సంకేతం. రియో ఒలింపిక్స్‌కు వెళ్లే మ‌న ప్రియ‌మైన క్రీడాకారుల‌కు ఆహ్లాద‌క‌ర‌మైన‌, ఉత్సాహ‌క‌ర‌మైన వాతావ‌ర‌ణాన్ని ఇద్దాం. ప్ర‌తి దానినీ గెలుపోట‌ముల‌తో ముడిపెట్ట‌కండి. క్రీడా స్ఫూర్తితో భార‌త‌దేశం ప్ర‌పంచంలో గుర్తింపు తెచ్చుకుంటోంది. క్రీడా ప్ర‌పంచంలో ఉన్న‌వారిని ప్రోత్స‌హించి, ఉత్సాహ‌క‌ర‌మైన వాతావ‌ర‌ణాన్ని క‌ల్పించ‌డంలో త‌మ‌ త‌మ‌ వంతు ప్ర‌య‌త్నించ‌మ‌ని దేశ‌ ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌ను కోరుతున్నాను.\nగ‌త ఎనిమిది, తొమ్మిది రోజుల నుండి ఏదో ఒక చోట నుండి ఫ‌లితాలు వ‌స్తున్నాయి.. నేను ఎన్నిక‌ల ఫ‌లితాల గురించి మాట్లాడ‌టం లేదు. సంవ‌త్స‌రం పొడ‌వునా క‌ష్ట‌ప‌డి ప‌రీక్ష‌లు రాసిన విద్యార్థుల గురించి మాట్లాడుతున్నాను. ప‌దో త‌ర‌గ‌తి, 12వ త‌ర‌గ‌తి.. ఒక‌దాని త‌రువాత మరొక‌టిగా ప‌రీక్షా ఫ‌లితాలు వ‌స్తూనే ఉన్నాయి. ఇందులో మ‌న అమ్మాయిలు వారి మేథాశక్తిని చాటి చెప్పారు. సంతోష‌క‌ర‌మైన వార్త‌.\nఈ ప‌రిణామాల‌లో నెగ్గిన‌వారికి శుభాకాంక్ష‌లు తెలియ‌జేస్తున్నాను. ఉత్తీర్ణులు కాని వారికి మ‌రోసారి నేను చెప్పేదేమిటంటే, జీవితంలో చేయ‌డానికి చాలా ఉంది. మ‌నం అనుకున్న ప‌రిణామాలు రాక‌పోతే, జీవితం అక్క‌డే ఆగిపోదు. ఆత్మ‌ విశ్వాసంతో జీవించాలి, ఆత్మ‌ విశ్వాసంతో ముందుకు సాగాలి.\nకానీ ఒక కొత్త‌ ర‌కం స‌మ‌స్య నా ముందుకు వ‌చ్చింది. నేను ఈ విష‌యం ఎప్పుడూ ఆలోచించ‌లేదు. నా mygov.in సైట్ లో ఒక ఇ-మెయిల్ వ‌స్తే, నా దృష్టి అటు వైపు వెళ్లింది. మ‌ధ్య‌ ప్ర‌దేశ్‌కు చెందిన గౌర‌వ్ ప‌టేల్ అనే ఆయన త‌న సమ‌స్యను నా ముందు ఉంచారు. గౌర‌వ్ ప‌టేల్ చెప్పింది ఇదీ.. నేను ఎమ్. పి. బోర్డ్ ప‌రీక్ష‌ల‌లో 89.33 శాతం మార్కులు సంపాదించి, ఉత్సాహంగా ఇంటికి చేరాను. నాలుగు వైపుల నుంచి నాకు అభినంద‌న‌లు అందుతాయి అని ఊహించాను. కానీ అంద‌రూ ”అయ్యో! ఇంకో నాలుగు మార్కులు వ‌స్తే, 90 శాతం అయ్యేది క‌దా! అన‌డం నాకు ఆశ్చ‌ర్యాన్ని క‌లిగించింది. అంటే- నా కుటుంబం, నా స్నేహితులు, నా టీచ‌ర్.. ఎవ‌రూ కూడా నా 89.33 శాతం మార్కుల‌తో సంతోష‌ప‌డ‌లేదు. అంద‌రిదీ ఒకే మాట‌.. ”ఇంకో నాలుగు మార్కులు వ‌స్తే, 90 శాతం అయ్యేది క‌దా” అనే. ఇటువం\nటి ప‌రిస్థితిని ఎలా ఎదుర్కోవాలో నాకు అర్థం కావ‌డంలేదు. జీవితంలో ఇదే స‌ర్వ‌స్వ‌మా..? నేను చేసింది క‌రెక్ట్ క‌దా…? నేను త‌క్కువ చ‌దివానా..? ఏమో.. నా మ‌న‌సుపై ఇది ఒక భారంగా అనిపిస్తుంది అంటూ ఆయన రాసి పంపారు.\nగౌర‌వ్‌.. మీరు చెప్పింది ఎంతో జాగ్ర‌త్త‌గా విన్నాను. అందులో క‌నిపించే ఆవేద‌న మీ ఒక్క‌రిదే కాదు. అది మీలాంటి ల‌క్ష‌ల, కోట్ల విద్యార్థుల‌ది అయి ఉండాలి. ఎందుకంటే. వాతావ‌ర‌ణ‌మే అలా మారిపోయింది కాబ‌ట్టి. సాధించిన దానికి సంతోషప‌డ‌కుండా సాధించ‌ని దాని గురించి వెతుకులాడ‌టం – ఇది ఏమీ చేయ‌లేక‌పోవ‌డానికి, వెనుక‌డుగు వేయ‌డానికి దారి తీస్తుంది. ప్ర‌తి విష‌యంలోనూ అసంపూర్ణ‌త్వాన్నే అంటే – వెలితినే వెతుకుతుంటే, మ‌నం స‌మాజాన్ని సంతోషం వైపు న‌డిపించ‌గ‌ల‌మా…? లేదు. మీరు సాధించిన 89.33 శాతం మార్కుల్ని మీ వాళ్లు, మీ మిత్రులు, మీ సాటి వారు మెచ్చుకుని ఉంటే బాగుండేది. ముందుముందు మ‌రింత అభివృద్ధి సాధించాల‌ని మీకు తోచుండేది. మీ అంద‌రినీ నేను కోరేది ఏమిటంటే – మీ పిల్ల‌లు ప‌రీక్ష ఫ‌లితాలు ఇంటికి తెచ్చిన‌ప్పుడు, వాటిని వాస్త‌వాలుగా ఒప్పుకోండి. సంతోషంగా, మ‌న‌స్ఫూర్తిగా మెచ్చుకోండి అని. మ‌రింత అభివృద్ధిని సాధించేందుకు వాళ్ల‌ను ప్రోత్స‌హించండి. లేక‌పోతే, వాళ్లు నూటికి నూరు తెచ్చుకున్నా – ”వంద‌కి వంద వ‌చ్చాయి, స‌రే. ఇంకా ఏదైనా చేసి ఉంటే బాగుండేది” అనే రోజు కూడా వ‌స్తుంది! ప్ర‌తి విష‌యానికి హ‌ద్దులుంటాయి. అది మ‌రిచిపోవద్దు.\nజోధ్‌పూర్ నుంచి సంతోష్ గిరిస్వామి కూడా దాదాపు ఇలాగే రాశారు. ఆయ‌న అన‌డం ఏమిటంటే .. నా చుట్టుప‌క్క‌ల ఉన్న‌వాళ్లు మ‌న ప‌రిస్థితుల్ని గుర్తించ‌డం లేదు అని. ఏదో ఒక‌టి- ఏదో ఒక‌టి మంచి చెయ్యాలంటారాయ‌న. చాలాకాలం క్రితం ఒక క‌విత చ‌దివాను. ఆ పంక్తులు స‌రిగా గుర్తులేవు. కానీ ఆ క‌వి ఏం రాశారంటే – జీవితం అనే బొమ్మలు వేసే గుడ్డ మీద నా వేద‌న‌ని చిత్రించాను. ఆ చిత్రాన్ని ప్ర‌ద‌ర్శ‌న‌లో ఉంచిన‌ప్పుడు చూసిన‌ వాళ్లు ”దీనికి మెరుగులు దిద్దాలి, నీలం రంగు బ‌దులు ప‌సుపు రంగు వాడుంటే బాగుండేది, ఆ గీత‌లు ఇటునుంచి కాకుండా అటునుంచి ఉండుంటే బాగుండేది” అని సూచనలు చేశారు ! నా చిత్రాన్ని చూసిన‌ వాళ్ల‌లో క‌నీసం ఒక‌రైనా క‌న్నీళ్లు పెట్టుకుంటారేమోన‌ని ఆశ‌ప‌డ్డాను అన్నారు. ఆయన సరిగ్గా ఈ మాట‌లే అన్న‌ట్లు నాకు గుర్తు లేదు. చాలా కాలం క్రితం రాసిన క‌విత అది. అయితే దాని భావం మాత్రం ఇదే. ఆ చిత్రంలో క‌నిపించే వేద‌న‌ను అర్థం చేసుకోవ‌డం లేదు కానీ, దానికి మెరుగులు దిద్దాల‌ని చెప్పేవాళ్లే ఎక్కువ మంది. సంతోష్‌గిరి గారు.. మీ ఆవేద‌న కూడా గౌర‌వ్ ఆవేద‌న లాగా .. కోటానుకోట్ల విద్యార్థుల వేద‌న‌ మాదిరిగానే ఉంది. ప్ర‌జ‌ల కోరిక‌ల‌ను పూర్తి చేసే బాధ్య‌త మీ మీద ఉంది. మిమ్మ‌ల్ని నేను కోరేది ఒక‌టే. ఇటువంటి స్థితిలో మీ నిబ్బ‌రాన్ని కోల్పోకండి. ఇత‌రులు చెప్పేది వింటుండండి. కానీ, మీ సంకల్పం నుండి మాత్రం దూరం కాకండి. మీర‌నుకున్న‌ది మ‌రింత బాగా చెయ్య‌డానికి ప్ర‌య‌త్నించండి. అయితే, ఫ‌లితాన్ని చూసి సంతోషించ‌క‌పోతే, కొత్త‌కొత్త నిర్మాణాలను ఎప్పుడూ చేప‌ట్ట‌లేరు. సాధించాం అన్న సంతోష‌మే, మ‌రింత సాధించ‌డానికి తోడ్ప‌డుతుంది. సాధించిన దాంట్లో కొద్దిపాటి నిరుత్సాహం కూడా మ‌రింత సాధించ‌డానికి మెట్టు కాలేదు. కానీ త‌ప్ప‌కుండా వెన‌క్కులాగుతుంది.\nఅందుక‌ని నేను మిమ్మ‌ల్ని కోరేది ఒక్క‌టే. మీరు ఎంత స‌ఫ‌లీకృతుల‌వుతారో, దాన్ని గుర్తించండి. లోతుల్లోకి వెళ్లండి. అందులో నుండే కొత్త‌వి సాధించ‌డానికి అవ‌కాశం ఉంది. అయితే ముఖ్యంగా మీ చుట్టుప‌క్క‌ల వారితో, మీ త‌ల్లితండ్రుల‌తో, మీ మిత్రుల‌తో చెప్ప‌ద‌ల్చుకున్న‌దేమిటంటే – మీ కోరిక‌ల భారాన్ని ద‌య‌చేసి మీ పిల్ల‌ల‌పై మాత్రం మోప‌కండి. ఒక్క‌టి మిత్రులారా..! జీవితంలో ఎప్పుడైనా సాధించ‌లేక‌పోతే ఆ జీవితం అక్క‌డితో ఆగిపోతుందా..? ప‌రీక్ష‌ల్లో మంచి మార్కులు సాధించ‌లేని పిల్లవాడు ఆట‌ల్లో అభివృద్ధి సాధిస్తాడు, సంగీతంలో ప్రావీణ్యం సంపాదిస్తాడు. చిత్ర‌లేఖ‌నంలో మెరుపులు చూపిస్తాడు, వ్యాపారంలో ముందుకువెళ‌తాడు. భ‌గ‌వంతుడు ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రికీ ఏదో ఒక అద్భుతమైన క‌ళ‌ని అందించే ఉంటాడు. అయితే, మీలో దాగివున్న ఆ శ‌క్తిని మీరు గుర్తించండి. దానికి మ‌రింత బ‌లాన్ని అందించండి. మీరు ముంద‌డుగు వేయ‌డం ఖాయం. జీవితంలో ఇది ఎదురుప‌డుతూనే ఉంటుంది. సంతూర్ అనే వాద్య‌ప‌రిక‌రం గురించి మీరు వినే ఉంటారు. ఒక‌ప్పుడు దీన్ని కశ్మీర్ లోయ‌లో జాన‌ప‌ద సంగీతంలో మాత్ర‌మే వాడేవారు దానిని. కానీ పండిట్ శివ‌కుమార్ అనే ఆయన దీన్ని వాడారు. ఫ‌లితం…? మొత్తం ప్ర‌పంచంలోనే అది ఒక గొప్ప వాద్య‌ప‌రిక‌ర‌మైంది. మ‌రి షెహ‌నాయి? ఒక‌ప్పుడు కొన్ని ప్రాంతాల‌కే ప‌రిమిత‌మై, మ‌హారాజుల కోట‌ గోడ‌ల మీద వాయింప‌బ‌డేది. కానీ ఉస్తాద్ బిస్మిల్లా ఖాన్ మ‌హోద‌యుడు దాని మీద చేయి వేసిన తరువాత అది ఒక ఉత్త‌మ వాద్యంగా గుర్తించ‌బ‌డి ,విశ్వ‌విఖ్యాత‌మైంది. అందుక‌ని, మీలో ఏం ఉంది… ఎలా ఉంది.. అన్న చింత వ‌దిలి, ఉన్న‌దాన్ని బ‌లోపేతం – మ‌రింత బ‌లోపేతం చెయ్యండి. ఫ‌లితం దానంత‌ట అదే వ‌స్తుంది.\nప్రియ‌మైన దేశ‌వాసులారా .. మ‌న దేశంలో బీద కుటుంబాల‌లో ఆరోగ్యం కాపాడుకోవ‌డానికి అయ్యే ఖ‌ర్చు ఒక్కొక్క‌ సారి వాళ్ల జీవ‌న‌ రీతుల్ని ఛిన్నభిన్నం చేయ‌డం అప్పుడ‌ప్పుడూ చూస్తుంటాం. రోగం రాకుండా ఉండేందుకు అయ్యే ఖ‌ర్చు నిజానికి చాలా త‌క్కువే. కానీ రోగం బారిన‌ప‌డి, దానిని న‌యం చేసుకోవ‌డానికయ్యే ఖ‌ర్చు మాత్రం చాలా ఎక్కువ‌. మ‌రి రోగాలే రాకుండా జాగ్ర‌త్త‌ప‌డి, మ‌న కుటుంబ ఆర్థిక స్థితిని మెరుగుప‌ర్చుకునేలా మ‌నం ఎందుకని జీవించకూడ‌దు…? రోగాల నుండి కాపాడుకోవాలంటే అన్నిటిక‌న్నా పెద్ద ఆయుధం శుభ్ర‌త‌. పేద‌వారికి ఎక్కువ‌గా లాభం చేకూర్చేది కేవ‌లం శుభ్ర‌తే. రెండో ఆయుధం ఏమిటంటే, నేను ప్ర‌తిసారి చెబుతుంటానే యోగం. దాన్ని యోగా అంటారు. జూన్ 21 అంత‌ర్రాష్ట్రీయ యోగా దినం. ప్ర‌పంచ‌మంత‌టా ఈ యోగా ప‌ట్ల ఒక ఆక‌ర్ష‌ణ‌, ఒక శ్ర‌ద్ధ ఉన్నాయి. ఎంతో మంది దీనిని స్వీక‌రించారు కూడా. స‌మ‌స్య‌ల‌తో నిండిపోయిన ఈ ప్ర‌పంచంలో సుఖంగా జీవించ‌డానికి కావ‌ల‌సిన శ‌క్తిని యోగా ఇస్తుంది. చికిత్స కంటే నివార‌ణ ముఖ్యం అన్నారు. యోగ‌ సాధ‌న చేసే వ్య‌క్తి ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉండ‌గ‌ల‌డు. తృప్తితో ఉండ‌గ‌ల‌డు, చ‌లించని మ‌నోనిబ్బ‌రాన్ని, ఏకాగ్ర‌త‌ను పెంపొందించుకోగ‌లడు, అనుకున్న‌ది సాధించ‌గ‌ల‌డు- ఇవ‌న్నీ అత‌నికి సాధ్య‌మ‌వుతాయి. జూన్ 21న యోగా దినం. ఇది ఒక కార్య‌క్ర‌మం కాదు. ఇదేమిట‌నేది అంద‌రికీ తెలియాలి. ప్ర‌తిఒక్క‌రూ యోగాని వారి జీవితంలో ఒక భాగం చేసుకోవాలి. వారి దినచ‌ర్య‌లో 20, 25, 30 నిమిషాలు దీని కోసం కేటాయించాలి. మ‌న జీవితాల‌ను ఇలా మార్చుకోవ‌డానికి జూన్ 21 మ‌న‌కు ప్రేరణ కావాలి. ఒక్కొక్క‌ సారి సామూహిక వాతావ‌ర‌ణం మ‌నిషి జీవితంలో మార్పు తీసుకురావ‌డానికి కార‌ణ‌మ‌వుతుంది. నేను కోరేది ఏమిటంటే.. జూన్ 21న‌, మీరుండేది ఏ ప్రాంత‌మైనా స‌రే. మీకు ఇంకా ఒక నెల‌ రోజులు స‌మ‌యం ఉంది. మీరు భార‌త ప్ర‌భుత్వ‌పు వెబ్‌సైట్‌లోకి వెళ్లి ఈసారి యోగా సిలబ‌స్ ఏమిటి..? ఏ ఏ ఆస‌నాలు ఏ విధంగా చేయాలి.. ఈ వివ‌రాలన్నీ పూర్తిగా వివ‌ర‌ణ‌ల‌తో ఉన్నాయి. వాటిని చూడండి. మీ గ్రామంలో వేయించండి. మీ ప్రాంతంలో వేయించండి. మీ ప‌ట్ట‌ణంలో వేయించండి. మీ బ‌డిలో వేయించండి. మీరు ఎక్క‌డుంటే అక్క‌డ వేయించండి ఇవాళ్టి నుంచి ఒక‌నెల ! ప్రారంభించండి ! చూస్తుండండి, జూన్ 21న మీరూ ఒక భాగ‌స్వామి అవుతారు. నేను చాలా చోట్ల చ‌దివాను కార్యాలయాలలో క్ర‌మం త‌ప్ప‌కుండా ఉద‌యాన్నే సామూహికంగా వ్యాయామం లాంటివి చేసిన‌ప్పుడు అక్క‌డివారు ఎంతో అభివృద్ధిని సాధించార‌ట‌. ఆ ఆఫీసు వాతావ‌ర‌ణ‌మే పూర్తిగా మారిపోయిందంట‌. మ‌రి మ‌న జీవితాల్లో యోగాను ఒక భాగంగా చేసుకోవ‌డానికి జూన్ 21ను మ‌నం ఉప‌యోగించుకోలేమా? మ‌న చుట్టుప‌క్క‌ల ప‌రిస‌రాల్లో యోగాను వ్యాప్తి చేయ‌లేమా? చెయ్య‌గ‌లం! చెయ్యాలి! ఈసారి నేను చండీగ‌ఢ్‌లో జ‌ర‌గ‌బోయే కార్య‌క్ర‌మానికి వెళ్ల‌బోతున్నాను. జూన్ 21న చండీగ‌ఢ్‌ వాసుల‌తో క‌లసి యోగాస‌నాలు వెయ్య‌బోతున్నాను. ఆరోజు మీరు కూడా అంద‌రితో పాటు విశ్వ‌వ్యాప్తంగా యోగ‌స‌నాలు వెయ్య‌బోతున్నారు. ఎటువంటి స్థితిలోనైనా వెనుక‌బ‌డిపోవొద్దు. ఇదే నా కోరిక‌. భార‌త‌దేశం ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉండాలంటే, మీరంద‌రూ ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉండ‌టం ఎంతో అవ‌స‌రం.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశ ప్రజలారా.. ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’ (మనసు లోని మాట) కార్యక్రమం ద్వారా నిరంత‌రం మిమ్మ‌ల్ని క‌లుస్తుంటాను. చాలా కాలం క్రింద‌ట నేను మీకు ఒక మొబైల్ నంబ‌ర్ ను ఇచ్చాను. దానికి మీరు మిస్ డ్ కాల్ ఇచ్చి ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’ (మనసు లోని మాట) కార్యక్రమాన్ని విన‌వ‌చ్చు అని చెప్పాను. ఇప్పుడ‌ది మ‌రింత సుల‌భ‌త‌రం అయింది. మీరు కేవ‌లం నాలుగంకెల నంబ‌ర్‌కు మిస్ డ్ కాల్ ఇచ్చి, ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’ (మనసు లోని మాట) కార్యక్రమం విన‌వ‌చ్చు. ఆ నంబ‌ర్ 1922. మీరు ఎక్క‌డుంటే అక్క‌డ‌, ఎప్పుడంటే అప్పుడు, ఏ భాషలో అంటే ఆ భాష‌లో ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’ (మనసు లోని మాట) కార్యక్రమాన్ని విన‌వ‌చ్చు.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశ ప్రజలారా.. మీ అంద‌రికీ మ‌రొక‌సారి నమస్కారములు. దయచేసి నేను నీటిని గురించి చెప్పిన మాట‌లను మీరు మ‌రిచిపోకండి. వాటిని మీరు జ్ఞాప‌కం పెట్టుకొనే తీరుతారు, కదూ? సరేనా ! మరి ఇక, ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు. న‌మ‌స్తే!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, namaskar!\nOnce again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through ‘Mann Ki Baat’. For me, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is not a matter of ritual; I myself am very eager to talk to you. And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in regional languages at 8 pm. I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov.in and also through the NarendraModiApp. A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government. How active should the government be in terms of public service? How much priority should be given to public welfare activities? In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use. I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people’s participation.\nThe summer heat is increasing day by day. We were hoping for some respite, instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature. And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry. Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar. Be it animals, birds or humans…everyone is suffering. These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation. Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees. In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.\n5th June is World Environment Day. On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment. This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme “Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade”. This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover. You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness, which led to the massive inferno. And so, it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us, to save forests and save water.\nRecently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.\nAs per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so. I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one. I carefully heard what each state had to say. Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state. Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem. In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.\nSome states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology. I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also. People’s participation is a strong base for solving such problems. And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water. My faith is that water is a Gift from God. When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts. We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness. Water is also an offering form the God. Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain. And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim ‘Per Drop More Crop’ through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake. At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers. When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour. I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation. And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation. If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved. Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers. In Andhra Pradesh, ‘Neeru Pragati Mission’ has been using technology for ground water recharging. People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,. ‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel. Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign. Madhya Pradesh has started the ‘Balram Talaab Yojana’- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their ‘Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.’ In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’. In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again. In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water. These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’. Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign. Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem. They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’. They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water. Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.\nThis is a wonderful experience. I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted. We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water. The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs. But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed? And the issue of water is not just for the farmers. This concerns everybody – the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor. And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save; how much water we stopped from flowing out. You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold. Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed. No matter how tired we are; when we see a large lake or an ocean, how magnificent that sight is. What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty! Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it! We should harvest water. We should also store water. We should also modernise water irrigation. This I say as an earnest appeal. We should not let this season go waste. The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water. And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large. Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail. I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever; I invite then as well.\nMy dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India. We have to make a transparent India. We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well. Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction. We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes; there was a barter system. If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return. If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange. Business was carried out only through the barter system. Then gradually came currency, coins came, notes came. But now times have changed. The whole world is moving towards a cashless society. Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money; we can buy things and pay our bills too. And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket. We need not worry about keeping an account; the account will be maintained automatically. In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us. And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened. On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers. And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian. So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society. You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card. In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card. And now-a-days a very small instrument has come which is called ‘point of sale’- P. O. S. – ‘Pos’. With the help of that, be it your Aadhar number or your RuPay card, if you have to pay money to someone, you can do it through that. There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it; there is no need to carry around any cash with you. One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money. The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work. It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app. If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.\nAcross the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents. In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step. Post offices have also been geared up for banking services. If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency. Under-hand dealings will stop; the influence of black money will be reduced. So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning. Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease. Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands. Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can’t do without those. Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.\nMy dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, “we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals… did we get a silver or not… should we do with just a bronze or not…” This happens. It is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges. But an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country.\nTo encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in one’s own way. Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons. Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not; our spirits should always soar high. And as I speak, I would like to mention our Sports Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart. Last week all of us were busy in the ups & downs of Assam election results. Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign. He was the Chief Ministerial candidate; but he was also the Union Minister. And I was very happy when I came to know that one day before the Assam election results, he discreetly reached Patiala in Punjab. You must be aware of the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports- N.I.S. – where the sportspersons going for the Olympics are trained. They all are there. He suddenly reached there, much to the surprise of the sportspersons. And it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well, that a Minister personally cares for our sportspersons. What are the arrangements for them? How is the food? Are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not? Are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there? Are all the training machines functioning properly? He surveyed everything in great detail. He personally inspected each and every sportsperson’s room. He spoke to all the players in great detail. He had a word with the management and trainers; he himself ate with the sportspersons. With election results being due, with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a Chief Minister, and yet if one of my colleagues, in the capacity of a Sports Minister, displays such concern for his work, then it gives me great joy. And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons. This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.\nLast time I spoke to you about the FIFA Under 17 World Cup and recently I got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in. And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country. Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams. I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App. Maybe many people don’t play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me. We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future. For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere. We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship. I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.\nIn the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country…. and I am not talking about election results… I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class. It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly. It is a matter of joy. To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations. And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life. Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations. We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.\nBut I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought. I’ve received one email on MyGov.in site, which drew my attention. One Mr. Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.P. Board exam he has secured 89.33% marks. Reading this I felt elated. But in his continued narration, he tells us his tale of woes. Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded. But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, “Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90%”. So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks. Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90% by four marks. Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation. Is this all to life. Was what I did not good enough? Did I not prove myself? I don’t know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.\nGaurav, I have read your letter very carefully. And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours; like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity. We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything. It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%. Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more. I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your children’s results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life. Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100% marks and you will say that, “you have got 100 percent! But still, had you done something more, it would have been better!” There is a limit to everything and that should be accepted.\nSantosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines. He says that the people around him just don’t accept the results. They say that you should have done something better. There was a poem I had read long ago. I don’t remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this – “I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life. And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, ‘yellow here would have been better in place of blue.’ Someone said, ‘This line would have been better situated there instead of here.’ I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.” I don’t remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back. But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture; everyone just spoke of touching it up.\nSantosh Giriji, you have the same problem that Gaurav has. And there must be crores of students like you. You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others. All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, don’t lose your balance. Everyone expresses their expectations; just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better. But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new. The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success. The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success; it guarantees failure. And so I would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved. Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier. I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please don’t impose your expectations upon your children. And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes. Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business. God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent. Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead. And this happens everywhere in life.\nYou must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor. There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley. But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world. Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music. It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings. But Ustad Bismillah Khan’s mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world; it has now carved an identity of its own. And so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that. Just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards.\nMy dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track. It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more. Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family. Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease. The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness. And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog. Some people also call it Yoga. 21st June is the International Day for Yog. People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it. This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world. To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life. Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does. 21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event. It should spread wide, it should find a place in every person’s life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog. And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration. These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individual’s life. I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative; you have a month with you. If you visit the website of the Government of India, the syllabus for this time, which ‘asanas’ you have to do, how one has to do them, all that has been described in it. Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices. Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June. I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change. Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives? Can we use it to bring Yog into our social life? Can we use it to bring Yog into our surroundings? I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June. I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh. You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day. I urge you all not to get left behind. Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.\nMy dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly. I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ by giving a missed call on that number. But now we have made it a lot simpler. Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits. That four digit number is 1-9-2-2 . I repeat …One- Nine- Two -Two. By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.\nMy dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again! Please don’t forget what I had said about water. You will remember it, won’t you? Okay! Thank You. Namaste!\n"
