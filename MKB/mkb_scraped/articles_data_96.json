        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this.

        "article": "\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসীগণ, আপনাদের সবাইকে নমস্কার!\n‘মন কা বাত’-এর এটি দ্বাদশ পর্ব। আর এইভাবে দেখতে দেখতে একবছর পার হয়ে গেল। গত বছর ৩-রা অক্টোবর প্রথমবার ‘মন কি বাত’-এ আমার কথা বলার সৌভাগ্য হয়েছিল। ‘মন কি বাত’-এর এক বছর সম্পূর্ণ – অনেক কথা হলো। আমি জানি না, আপনারা কি পেয়েছেন, কিন্তু আমি এটা অবশ্যই বলতে পারি যে আমি অনেক কিছু পেয়েছি। গণতন্ত্রে জনশক্তির অপার মহিমা আছে। আমার জীবনে এক মৌলিক চিন্তা আছে আর সেজন্যই আমার জনশক্তির ওপর অগাধ বিশ্বাস আছে। ‘মন কি বাত’ আমাকে যা শিখিয়েছে, যা বুঝিয়েছে, যা জেনেছি, যা অনুভব করেছি, তা থেকে বলতে পারি যে, আমরা যতটা ভেবেছি, জনগণের শক্তি তার থেকে অনেক বেশি। আমাদের পূর্বসূরীরা জনতা-জনার্দনের কথা বলেছেন, বলেছেন তাঁরা ঈশ্বরের অংশ। আমি ‘মন কি বাত’ থেকে আমার যে অনুভব হয়ছে, তাতে বলতে পারি যে, আমাদের পূর্বসূরীদের চিন্তাতে মস্ত বড় শক্তি আছে, খুব বড় সত্য আছে, কারণ আমি এটা অনুভব করেছি। ‘মন কি বাত’-এর জন্য আমি সবার কাছ থেকে পরামর্শ চেয়েছি, কিন্তু প্রতিবার হয়ত দু-চারটি পরামর্শ দেখা বা বোঝার চেষ্টা করতে পেরেছি। কিন্তু লক্ষ লক্ষ মানুষ সক্রিয়ভাবে আমাকে পরামর্শ দিয়ে যাচ্ছেন। এটা নিজেই এক মস্ত বড় শক্তি। নাহলে প্রধানমন্ত্রীকে খবর দিচ্ছেন, mygov.in-এই সাইটে লিখছেন, চিঠি পাঠাচ্ছেন, কিন্তু আমি একটুও সুযোগ পাচ্ছি না সেগুলি দেখার। যে কোনও মানুষ এতে নিরাশ হতে পারতেন, কিন্তু আমার তা মনে হচ্ছে না। হ্যাঁ, এই লক্ষ লক্ষ চিঠি আমাকে এক বড় শিক্ষা দিয়েছে। সরকারের অনেক সূক্ষ্ম সূক্ষ্ম অসুবিধার বিষয়ে আমি জানতে পারি, আর আমি আকাশবাণীকেও অভিনন্দন জানাই যে এই সমস্ত পরামর্শগুলোকে শুধুমাত্র কাগজের টুকরো মনে না করে, জনগণের আকাঙ্ক্ষাকে মর্যাদা দিয়েছেন। তাঁরা এইসব বিষয়ে অনুষ্ঠান করেছেন, সরকারের বিভিন্ন বিভাগের আধিকারিকদের আকাশবাণীতে ডেকে তাঁদের সামনে সাধারণ মানুষের এই সমস্ত চাহিদা বিচার-বিবেচনা করা হয়েছে, আর দেখা হয়েছে যে এর মধ্যে কোনগুলি পলিসি ম্যাটার, কোনটি কোন বিশেষ ব্যক্তির জন্য অসুবিধেজনক হয়ে উঠেছে, কোনটির ওপর থেকে সরকারের নজর সরে গেছে? একদম গ্রাসরুট লেভেল থেকেও বহু খবর সরকারের কাছে এসে পৌঁছচ্ছে। আর সরকারের এটি একটি মৌলিক সিদ্ধান্ত যে খবর নীচ থেকে ওপরতলায় এসে পৌঁছবে, আর পথ দেখানো হবে ওপর থেকে নীচে। একথা কে ভাবতে পেরেছিল যে এই খবরের স্রোতধারা একদিন ‘মন কি বাত’-এ পরিণত হবে। কিন্তু এটা বাস্তবে সম্ভব হয়েছে। আর এভাবেই ‘মন কি বাত’ সমাজের নিজস্ব চিন্তাভাবনা প্রকাশের এক মাধ্যম হয়ে উঠেছে। আমি একবার কথায় কথায় বলেছিলাম selfy with daughter–এর কথা। আর তাই শুনে সারা দুনিয়া আশ্চর্য হয়ে গিয়েছিল। কিন্তু সমস্ত বিশ্ব থেকে লক্ষাধিক selfy with daughter–এর ছবি এসে পৌঁছেছে এবং কন্যাসন্তানেরা এতে গৌরবান্বিত হয়েছেন। আর যখন তাঁরা selfy with daughter তুলেছেন, তখন শুধুমাত্র নিজেদের কন্যাসন্তানদেরই গৌরবান্বিত করেননি, নিজেদের ভেতরেও এক সংকল্প জাগিয়ে তুলেছেন। আর এইসমস্ত selfy-গুলো যখন অন্যরা দেখছেন, তাঁদের প্রত্যেকেরই মনে হয়েছে তাঁদেরও কন্যাসন্তানের প্রতি উদাসীনতা ত্যাগ করতে হবে। এটা এক নিঃশব্দ বিপ্লব।\nআমি ভারতের পর্যটনের বিষয়টিকে মাথায় রেখে এভাবেই একবার ইন্‌ক্রেডিবল্‌ ইণ্ডিয়ার কথা বলেছিলাম। বলেছিলাম যখনই আপনারা কোথাও বেড়াতে যাবেন, সেখানকার ভাল ভাল ছবি তুলে আমাকে পাঠাবেন, আমি দেখব। এইরকম খুব সাধারণ হাল্‌কা চালে বলা কথার কী আশ্চর্যজনক ফলাফলই না আমাদের সামনে এসেছে। ভারতের প্রতিটি কোণা থেকে মানুষ লক্ষাধিক সংখ্যায় এইরকম ছবি পাঠিয়েছেন। রাজ্য সরকার বা কেন্দ্রীয় সরকারের পর্যটন বিভাগ ভাবতেও পারেনি যে আমাদের দেশে এত ধরনের অমূল্য সম্পদ আছে। একটা নির্দিষ্ট মঞ্চে সবাইকে আনা সম্ভব হয়েছে সরকারের একটি পয়সাও খরচ না করে। মানুষজন সরকারের কাজ বাড়িয়েছেন। গত বছর অক্টোবরের আগে আমি গান্ধী জয়ন্তীর কথা উল্লেখ করে লোকেদের অনুরোধ করেছিলাম যে, ২-রা অক্টোবর আমরা মহাত্মা গান্ধীর জন্মদিন যখন পালন করব, তখন যেন ‘খাদি ফর নেশন’-এর কথা মাথায় রাখি। আর এটা কি সময়ের দাবি নয় যে আমরা ‘খাদি ফর নেশন’-এর কথা মাথায় রেখে খাদির জিনিস কেনার কথা ভাবব। অল্পসল্প হলেও যেন আমরা খাদির জিনিস কিনি। আজ আমি অত্যন্ত আনন্দের সঙ্গে বলতে পারি যে গত একবছরে খাদির বিক্রি প্রায় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। আর এটা কোনো সরকারি বিজ্ঞাপনের জন্য হয়নি। কোটি কোটি টাকাও এজন্য খরচ করতে হয়নি। এ ছিল জনশক্তি-র এক বিশ্বাস, এক অনুভূতি।\nএকবার ‘মন কি বাত’-এ আমি বলেছিলাম যে গরীবদের ঘরে উনুন জ্বলে, তার ধোঁয়ায় বাচ্চাদের চোখে জল আসে, গরীব মায়ের কি গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডার পাওয়ার কোনও অধিকার নেই? আমি আর্থিকভাবে সম্পন্ন লোকেদের অনুরোধ করেছিলাম যে আপনারা গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডারের জন্য যে ভর্তুকি আছে তা প্রত্যর্পণ করুন। আপনারা ভাবুন। আর আজ আমি আনন্দের সঙ্গে এটা বলতে পারি যে এদেশের প্রায় তিরিশ লক্ষ পরিবার গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডারের ভর্তুকি ছেড়ে দিয়েছেন। তাঁরা কেউই কিন্তু বড়লোক নন। এক টিভি চ্যানেলে আমি দেখেছিলাম, একজন বিধবা মহিলা, তিনি অবসরপ্রাপ্ত শিক্ষিকা, গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডারের ভর্তুকি প্রত্যর্পণের লাইনে দাঁড়িয়ে আছেন। সমাজের মধ্যবিত্ত, নিম্ন-মধ্যবিত্ত পরিবার, যাঁদের পক্ষে ভর্তুকি ছেড়ে দেওয়া যথেষ্ট অসুবিধাজনক, তাঁরাও কিন্তু ভর্তুকির সুবিধা ত্যাগ করেছেন। এটা কি কোনও নিঃশব্দ বিপ্লব নয়? এটা জনতার শক্তির প্রদর্শন নয়? সরকারেরও এই শিক্ষা নিতে হবে যে আমাদের সরকারি পরিধির বাইরে এক বৃহৎ জনশক্তি আছে, যাঁদের সামর্থ্য, উৎসাহ আর সংকল্প অনেক বেশি। সরকার যত জনগণের সঙ্গে সম্পর্ক রেখে কাজ করবে, ততই সমাজের উন্নতির ক্ষেত্রে সে এক ভাল অনুঘটক হিসাবে কাজ করতে পারবে।\n‘মন কি বাত’-এ আমার যে সমস্ত বিষয়ের প্রতি ভরসা ছিল, আজ তা বিশ্বাসে পরিণত হয়েছে, তার প্রতি শ্রদ্ধা জেগেছে। আর এজন্যই আমি আজ ‘মন কি বাত’-এর মাধ্যমে আর একবার জনশক্তিকে অভিনন্দন জানাতে চাই, প্রণাম করতে চাই। আমার দেশের জনগণ প্রতিটি ছোট ছোট কথাকে গুরুত্ব দিয়ে দেশের কল্যাণে নিজেদেরকে নিয়োজিত করার চেষ্টা করে চলেছেন। এর থেকে বড় আনন্দ আর কি হতে পারে?\n‘মন কি বাত’-এর এই পর্বে আমি এক নতুন প্রয়াস গ্রহণ করার কথা ভেবেছি। আমি জনগণের কাছে প্রার্থনা করেছিলাম যে, আপনারা আপনাদের প্রশ্ন, আপনাদের পরামর্শ দূরভাষের মাধ্যমে জানান। আমি ‘মন কি বাত’-এ সেই বিষয়গুলি নিয়ে আলোচনা করব। আমার আনন্দ হচ্ছে এই ভেবে যে দেশের বিভিন্ন প্রান্ত থেকে প্রায় পঞ্চান্ন হাজারের বেশি ফোন এসেছে। সিয়াচেন, কচ্ছ বা কামরূপই হোক অথবা কাশ্মীর থেকে কন্যাকুমারিকা – ভারতের এমন কোনও জায়গা নেই, যেখান থেকে জনসাধারণ ফোন করেন নি। এটা আমার নিজের এক সুখানুভূতি। সব বয়সের মানুষ ফোন করেছেন। কিছু ফোন তো আমি নিজে শুনেছি এবং আমার ভালো লেগেছে। বাকি ফোনগুলি নিয়ে আমার সরকারের অন্য আধিকারিকরা কাজ করছেন। আপনাদের হয়ত ফোন করতে এক-দু’মিনিট সময় লেগেছে, কিন্তু আমার কাছে আপনাদের এই অল্প সময়ের ফোন কল, পরামর্শ অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। আমার পুরো সরকার আপনাদের পরামর্শ অনুযায়ী কাজ করবে। একটা বিষয়ে আমার খুব আশ্চর্য লেগেছে এবং আনন্দও হয়েছে। যখন চারদিকে negativity অর্থাৎ নেতিবাচক মনোভাব রয়েছে, তখন আমার অনুভূতি অন্য কথা বলে। এই পঞ্চান্ন হাজার মানুষ তাঁদের নিজেদের মত করে নিজেদের কথা বলেছেন। তাঁরা যা খুশি বলতে পারতেন, কারণ এই ব্যাপারে কোন বাধা ছিল না। কিন্তু আমি আশ্চর্য হয়ে দেখলাম, তাঁদের সব কথার মধ্যে ‘মন কি বাত’-এর প্রভাব পড়েছে। পুরোপুরি ইতিবাচক কথা, ইতিবাচক পরামর্শ তাঁরা দিয়েছেন। কাজেই দেখুন, দেশের সাধারণ মানুষও কতটা ইতিবাচক মনোভাব নিয়ে চলেন। দেশের জন্য এ এক বড় সম্পদ। এক কি দুই শতাংশ ফোনেই হয়ত কোনও গুরুতর অভিযোগ ছিল। নাহলে নব্বই শতাংশ ফোনই উৎসাহব্যঞ্জক এবং আনন্দদায়ক ছিল। আর একটা বিষয় আমাদের নজরে এসেছে, বিশেষভাবে সক্ষম ব্যক্তি, বিশেষ করে দৃষ্টিহীন ব্যক্তিদের কাছ থেকে প্রচুর ফোন এসেছে। এর একটা কারণ এটা হতে পারে যে যেহেতু তাঁদের টিভি দেখার সৌভাগ্য হয় না, তাই তাঁরা রেডিওটা অবশ্যই শোনেন। এর থেকে আমি এটা বুঝতে পেরেছি যে দৃষ্টিহীন ব্যক্তিদের কাছে রেডিও কতটা গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। আমি এক নতুন দিশা পেয়েছি এইসব ফোনের থেকে। সরকারকে আরও সংবেদনশীল করার জন্য এই ফোনগুলি অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ।\nরাজস্থানের আলওয়ার থেকে পবন আচার্য আমাকে এক পরামর্শ দিয়েছেন। আমার মনে হয় সকলের এটা শোনা উচিত এবং গোটা দেশের মানুষেরই তা মানা উচিত। উনি কি বলতে চাইছেন, তা অবশ্যই শুনুন – “আমার নাম পবন আচার্য, আমি রাজস্থানের আলওয়ারে থাকি। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শ্রী নরেন্দ্র মোদীজীর কাছে আমার বক্তব্য এই যে, এবার মন কি বাত-এ আপনি সারা দেশের মানুষকে অনুরোধ জানান, দীপাবলীতে যেন তাঁরা মাটির প্রদীপ ব্যবহার করেন। এতে যেমন পরিবেশের উপকার হবে, তেমনই হাজার হাজার কুমোর ভাইয়েরা লাভবান হবেন। ধন্যবাদ।”\nপবন, আমার বিশ্বাস, হাওয়ার বেগে আপনার এই পরামর্শ ভারতের কোণে কোণে ছড়িয়ে পড়বে। খুব ভাল পরামর্শ দিয়েছেন। মাটি নিজেই অমূল্য আর তাই মাটির প্রদীপও অমূল্য। পরিবেশের দিক থেকেও এর একটা দাম আছে। প্রদীপ তৈরি হয় গরীবদের ঘরে। দরিদ্র মানুষ এই কাজ করে নিজেদের সংসার চালান। আর আমি দেশবাসীকে এটা বলতে চাই, আসন্ন দীপাবলী উৎসবে আমরা যদি পবন আচার্য-র পরামর্শ মেনে চলি, তাহলে প্রদীপ জ্বলবে আমাদের ঘরে, আর তার আলো ছড়িয়ে পড়বে দরিদ্র মানুষের ঘরে।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, গণেশ চতুর্থীর দিন সেনাবাহিনীর জওয়ানদের সঙ্গে আমার দু-তিন ঘণ্টা সময় কাটানোর সুযোগ হয়েছিল। জল, স্থল ও বায়ুপথে সুরক্ষা দেন যাঁরা সেই জলসেনা, স্থলসেনা এবং বায়ুসেনা – আর্মি, এয়ারফোর্স ও নেভি-র জওয়ানদের সঙ্গে আমি সময় কাটিয়েছি। ১৯৬৫-তে পাকিস্তানের সঙ্গে যে যুদ্ধ হয়েছিল, তার ৫০ বছর পূর্তি উপলক্ষে দিল্লিতে ইণ্ডিয়ান গেটের কাছে এক ‘শৌর্যাঞ্জলী’ প্রদর্শনীর আয়োজন করা হয়েছে। আমি খুব উৎসাহ নিয়ে এই প্রদর্শনী দেখছিলাম। গিয়েছিলাম তো আধঘণ্টার জন্য, কিন্তু যখন প্রদর্শনী দেখে বেরোলাম, তখন আড়াই ঘণ্টা পেরিয়ে গেছে – তাও সম্পূর্ণ প্রদর্শনী দেখা হয়ে ওঠে নি। কি ছিল না সেখানে – পুরো ইতিহাসকে জীবন্ত করে তুলে ধরা হয়েছে। সৌন্দর্যের দিক থেকে দেখলে বলব অনুপম। ইতিহাসের দিক থেকে দেখলে বলব অত্যন্ত শিক্ষামূলক, আর জীবনে উৎসাহ পাওয়ার জন্য দেখলে বলব যে মাতৃভূমির সেবা করার জন্য এর থেকে বড় কোনও অনুপ্রেরণা আর কিছু হতে পারে না। যুদ্ধকালীন যেসব গৌরবজনক মুহূর্ত, আমাদের সেনাবাহিনীর যে সমস্ত অদম্য সাহস ও বলিদানের কথা আমরা শুনেছি, এই প্রদর্শনীর মাধ্যমে তা আমরা উপলব্ধি করতে পারি। কারণ তখনকার কোনো ছবি আমরা পাইনি, ভিডিওগ্রাফিও সম্ভব ছিল না। হাজি পীর-এর লড়াই বা একদম দেশের উত্তরদিকের লড়াই, চামিণ্ডার লড়াই বা হাজি পীর পাস জয়ের দৃশ্য, যাই দেখুন না কেন, এক রোমাঞ্চকর অনুভূতি হয় এবং আমাদের সেনা জওয়ানদের জন্য গর্ব হয়। আমি এই সমস্ত বীর সেনানীদের পরিবারগুলির সঙ্গে, এমনকি সেই সমস্ত পরিবারের সঙ্গেও দেখা করেছি, যাঁদের নিকট আত্মীয়রা জীবন বলিদান দিয়েছেন এই যুদ্ধে। যে সমস্ত জীবিত মানুষ এই যুদ্ধে অংশ নিয়েছিলেন, তাঁরা আজ তাঁদের জীবনের অন্তিম পর্বে এসে পৌঁছেছেন। এঁরা সবাই এসেছিলেন এই প্রদর্শনীতে, আর যখন তাঁদের সঙ্গে করমর্দণ করবার সুযোগ আমার হয়েছিল, তখন মনে হয়েছিল, কী অসীম প্রাণশক্তি তাঁদের। এটা আমাকে প্রেরণা দিয়েছে। আপনারা যদি ইতিহাস তৈরি করতে চান, তাহলে ইতিহাসের সূক্ষ্মাতিসূক্ষ্ম বিষয়গুলি জানা, বোঝা জরুরি। আমাদের নিজেদের শিকড়ের সঙ্গে যোগসূত্র তৈরি করে ইতিহাস। ইতিহাসের সঙ্গে যদি সম্পর্ক ছেদ হয়ে যায়, তো নতুন ইতিহাস তৈরির সম্ভাবনাও বিনাশপ্রাপ্ত হয়। এই ধরণের বীরত্বব্যঞ্জক প্রদর্শনীর মাধ্যমে আমরা ইতিহাসকে অনুভব করতে পারি, ইতিহাসকে জানতে পারি এবং নূতন ইতিহাস সৃষ্টির প্রেরণার বীজ বপন করতে পারি। এই প্রদর্শনী আরও কিছুদিন চলবে। আমার অনুরোধ, আপনারা যাঁরা দিল্লির আশেপাশে থাকেন, আপনাদের পরিবারের সঙ্গে এই প্রদর্শনী অবশ্যই দেখুন এবং আমার মত তাড়াহুড়ো করে নয়। ধীরে সুস্থে দেখুন। আমি তো দু-আড়াই ঘণ্টায় ফিরে এসেছি, আপনারা নিশ্চয়ই ঘণ্টা তিন-চারেক সময় নিয়ে দেখবেন। অবশ্যই দেখবেন।\nগণতন্ত্রের শক্তি দেখুন, একটি ছোট ছেলে প্রধানমন্ত্রীকে আদেশ করছে, কিন্তু ওই ছোট ছেলেটি তাড়াহুড়োয় নিজের নাম বলতে ভুলে গেছে। ওর নামটা তো আমার জানা নেই, কিন্তু তার কথা প্রধানমন্ত্রীর অনুধাবনযোগ্য তো বটেই, আমাদের সমস্ত দেশবাসীরও অনুধাবনযোগ্য। শুনুন এই ছোট ছেলেটি আমাদের কী বলছে –\n“প্রধানমন্ত্রী মোদীজী, আমি আপনাকে বলতে চাই যে আপনি যে স্বচ্ছ ভারত অভিযান শুরু করেছেন, তার জন্য সব জায়গায়, সমস্ত গলিতে ডাস্টবিনের ব্যবস্থা করুন।”\nএই বালকটি ঠিকই বলেছে। স্বচ্ছতাকে আমাদের স্বভাবগত করা উচিত এবং তার জন্য উপযুক্ত ব্যবস্থা নেওয়া উচিত। এই বালকটির কথা শুনে আমার খুব আনন্দ হয়েছে। আনন্দ এই জন্যই যে ২-রা অক্টোবর আমি স্বচ্ছ ভারত অভিযান চালানোর কথা ঘোষণা করি, আর আমি এটা বলতে পারি যে স্বাধীনতার পর সম্ভবত এই প্রথম সংসদে স্বচ্ছতা নিয়ে আজকাল ঘণ্টার পর ঘণ্টা আলোচনা চলে। আমাদের সরকারের কাজকর্ম নিয়েও আলোচনা হয়। আমাকেও অনেক কথা শুনতে হয়, যে মোদীজী তো স্বচ্ছতা নিয়ে অনেক বড় বড় কথা বলেন, কিন্তু কী হচ্ছে শেষ পর্যন্ত? আমার এতে খারাপ লাগে না। এর মধ্যে আমি ভালোটাই দেখি – দেশের সংসদও এখন ভারতের স্বচ্ছতা নিয়ে আলোচনা করছে। আর অন্যদিকে দেখুন, একদিকে সংসদ আর একদিকে দেশের শিশু – দুজনেই স্বচ্ছতা নিয়ে কথা বলছেন। এর থেকে বড় সৌভাগ্য দেশের আর কী হতে পারে? স্বচ্ছতা নিয়ে এই যে আন্দোলন তৈরি হয়েছে, আবর্জনার প্রতি ঘৃণার যে বাতাবরণ তৈরি হয়েছে, পরিচ্ছন্নতার প্রতি যে সচেতনতা এসেছে, তা এই সরকারকেও স্বচ্ছ ভারত তৈরির জন্য কাজ করতে বাধ্য করবে – করবে – করবে। স্থানীয় স্বশাসিত সংস্থা – সেটা পঞ্চায়েত, নগর পঞ্চায়েত, পুর নিগম, মহানগর পৌর নিগম বা রাজ্য অথবা কেন্দ্র – প্রতিটি সংস্থাকে এই বিষয়ে কাজ করতে হবে। এই আন্দোলনকে অসুবিধার মধ্যেও আমাদের এগিয়ে নিয়ে যেতে হবে। আর ২০১৯ খ্রিস্টাব্দে আমরা যখন মহাত্মা গান্ধীর ১৫০-তম জন্মজয়ন্তী পালন করবো, তখন মহাত্মা গান্ধীর স্বপ্নকে সফল করার উদ্দেশ্যে আমরা সঠিক পথে এগোবো। আপনারা কি জানেন, মহাত্মা গান্ধী কি বলতেন? মহাত্মা গান্ধী একবার বলেছিলেন, স্বাধীনতা ও স্বচ্ছতা – এই দুটোর মধ্যে যদি আমাকে একটা পছন্দ করতে হয়, তাহলে আমি প্রথমে স্বচ্ছতাকে পছন্দ করবো, স্বাধীনতাকে পরে। গান্ধীজীর কাছে স্বাধীনতার থেকে স্বচ্ছতা বেশি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল। আসুন, সবাই মহাত্মা গান্ধীর কথা অনুসরণ করি এবং তাঁর ইচ্ছা পূরণ করতে কিছু পদক্ষেপ আমরাও নিই। দিল্লির গুলশন অরোরা mygov.in পোর্টালে একটি বার্তা পাঠিয়েছেন। উনি দীনদয়ালজী-র জন্মশতাব্দী সম্বন্ধে জানতে চেয়েছেন। আমার প্রিয় দেশবাসীগণ, মহাপুরুষদের জীবন দর্শন আমাদের প্রেরণার উৎস। আর আমাদের কাজ হল মহাপুরুষদের বিচারধারা অনুসরণ করা, তার মূল্যায়ন করার দায়িত্ব আমাদের নয়। দেশের জন্য যাঁরা জীবনপাত করেছেন, তাঁরা প্রত্যেকেই আমাদের অনুপ্রেরণার উৎস। আর আজকাল অনেক মহাপুরুষদের স্মরণ করার সুযোগ আসছে – ২৫শে সেপ্টেম্বর পণ্ডিত দীনদয়াল উপাধ্যায়, ২-রা অক্টোবর মহাত্মা গান্ধী ও লাল বাহাদুর শাস্ত্রী, ১১-ই অক্টোবর জয়প্রকাশ নারায়ণ এবং ৩১-শে অক্টোবর সর্দার বল্লভভাই প্যাটেল-এর জন্মজয়ন্তী – এরকম অনেক নাম আমরা স্মরণ করতে পারি, কারণ আমাদের দেশ হলো বহু রত্নে ভূষিত। যে কোনও দিনই ঐতিহাসিক দৃষ্টিতে কোনো না কোনো মহাপুরুষের নামের সঙ্গে জড়িয়ে আছে। আগামী দিনগুলিতে আমরা এই সব মহাপুরুষদের স্মরণ করবো, তাঁদের জীবন দর্শন আমরা প্রত্যেক ঘরে পৌঁছে দেবো, আর এর থেকে কিছু না কিছু শেখার চেষ্টা করবো।\nআমি বিশেষ করে ২-রা অক্টোবর-এর উল্লেখ করতে চাইবো, ওইদিন পূজনীয় মহাত্মা গান্ধীর জন্মদিন, আমি গত বছরও বলেছিলাম, আপনাদের বিভিন্ন ফ্যাশনের কাপড় আছে, বিভিন্ন প্রকার ফ্যাব্রিক আছে, আরও অনেক প্রকার বস্তু রয়েছে, কিন্তু খাদির সামগ্রীর একটা বিশেষ স্থান হওয়া উচিত।\nআমি আরেকবার অনুরোধ করছি যে, ২-রা অক্টোবর থেকে এক মাস খাদি বস্ত্রের উপর বিশেষ ছাড় দেওয়া হয়। এই সুযোগের সদ্ব্যবহার করুন। খাদির সঙ্গে সঙ্গে তাঁত শিল্পকেও সমান গুরুত্ব দেওয়া দরকার। আমাদের তন্তুবায়রা এত পরিশ্রম করেন, যদি আমরা ১২৫ কোটি দেশবাসী ৫ টাকা, ১০ টাকা অথবা ৫০ টাকা মূল্যের কোন বয়নশিল্পজাত অথবা খাদির কোন সামগ্রী কিনে নিই, তাহলে শেষ পর্যন্ত সেই টাকা গরীব তন্তুবায়দের ঘরেই পৌঁছবে – খাদি প্রস্তুতকারী কোন দরিদ্র বিধবার ঘরে পৌঁছবে। আর এই জন্যই এই দীপাবলিতে আমরা নিশ্চয়ই খাদিকে আমাদের ঘরে জায়গা দেব, খাদিবস্ত্র পরিধান করব। আমি এটা বলতে চাইছি না যে, আপনারা সম্পূর্ণরূপে খাদিবস্ত্র পরিধান করুন, আমার বলার উদ্দেশ্য হল যে, কিছু খাদি সামগ্রী ব্যবহার করুন। আর দেখুন, গতবার খাদিবস্ত্রের বিক্রি দ্বিগুণ হয়ে গিয়েছিল। কত দরিদ্র মানুষের উপকার হয়েছে। যে কাজ সরকার লক্ষ-কোটি টাকা বিজ্ঞাপনের মাধ্যমে খরচ করেও করতে পারে না, সেই কাজ আপনাদের ক্ষুদ্র সাহায্যে সম্ভব হয়েছে। এটাই তো ‘জনশক্তি’। আর এইজন্যই আমি আরেকবার এই কাজের জন্য আপনাদের অনুরোধ করছি।\nপ্রিয় দেশবাসী, একটি বিষয় আমার মন আনন্দে ভরিয়ে দিয়েছে। আমার মনের ইচ্ছা, আপনারাও এই আনন্দের শরিক হন। আমি মে মাসে কলকাতায় গিয়েছিলাম। সুভাষ চন্দ্র বসু-র পরিবারের কয়েকজন আমার সঙ্গে দেখা করতে এসেছিলেন। ওঁর ভ্রাতুষ্পুত্র চন্দ্র বসু সব ব্যবস্থা করেছিলেন। সুভাষবাবুর পরিবারের লোকজনের সঙ্গে খোশ মেজাজে বেশ কিছুটা সময় কাটানোর সুযোগ হয়েছিল। ওই দিনই ঠিক করা হয়েছিল যে সুভাষবাবুর বৃহৎ পরিবারের লোকজন প্রধানমন্ত্রীর বাসভবনে আসবেন। চন্দ্র বসু ও তাঁর পরিবারের লোকেরা এই ব্যাপারটা দেখাশোনা করছেন। আর গত সপ্তাহে আমি জানতে পারি যে, সুভাষবাবুর পরিবারের পঞ্চাশেরও বেশি সদস্য প্রধানমন্ত্রীর বাসভবনে আসবেন। আপনারা কল্পনা করতে পারেন এই বিষয়টি আমার জন্য কতটা আনন্দদায়ক। হয়তো তাঁরা সবাই মিলে এই প্রথমবার প্রধানমন্ত্রীর বাসভবনে আসছেন। কিন্তু আমার জন্য সবথেকে বেশি খুশির বিষয় এটাই যে প্রধানমন্ত্রীর বাসভবনে এরকম আতিথেয়তা করার সুযোগ কখনই আসেনি, যে সুযোগ অক্টোবর মাসে আমি পাব। সুভাষবাবুর পরিবারের ৫০ জনেরও অধিক সদস্য, যাঁর বিভিন্ন দেশে থাকেন, তাঁরা সবাই আসছেন। আমার কাছে এটা বড়ই আনন্দঘন মুহূর্ত। আমি ওঁদের স্বাগত জানানোর জন্য আগ্রহী, খুব আনন্দ অনুভব করছি।\nভার্গবী কান্‌ড়ে আমাকে এক বার্তা পাঠিয়েছেন। তাঁর বলার ধরণ, তার কণ্ঠস্বর শুনে আমার মনে হয়েছে উনি একজন নেত্রী, বা নেত্রী হতে চলেছেন। উনি বলেছেন, “আমার নাম ভার্গবী কান্‌ড়ে। আমি প্রধানমন্ত্রীর কাছে এই অনুরোধ করতে চাই যে, আপনি যুবসমাজকে ভোটার রেজিস্ট্রেশন করার জন্য সচেতন করুন। যার ফলে আগামী দিনে যুবসমাজের যোগদান বাড়বে আর ভবিষ্যতে সরকার গঠনে ও পরিচালনায় যুবসমাজ মহত্বপূর্ণ যোগদান করতে পারে। ধন্যবাদ।”\nভোটার তালিকায় নাম নথিভূক্ত করা এবং ভোটদান প্রসঙ্গে ভার্গবী বলেছেন। আপনি ঠিকই বলেছেন। গণতন্ত্রে প্রত্যেক ভোটার দেশের ভাগ্যবিধাতা। আর এই সচেতনতা ধীরে ধীরে বাড়ছে। ভোটদানের শতকরা হারও বাড়ছে। আর আমি এজন্য ভারতের নির্বাচন কমিশনকে বিশেষভাবে ধন্যবাদ জানাই। কয়েক বছর আগেও আমরা দেখেছি যে নির্বাচন কমিশন কেবলমাত্র নির্বাচন প্রক্রিয়া পরিচালনা করতেন। কিন্তু গত কয়েক বছরে এর এক বড়ো পরিবর্তন এসেছে। আজ আমাদের নির্বাচন কমিশন কেবলমাত্র নির্বাচন পরিচালক নয়, এক সহায়কের কাজ করছেন, ভোটার-ফ্রেণ্ডলি হয়ে গেছেন, আর তাদের সমস্ত চিন্তাধারা, সমস্ত পরিযোজনার কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হ’ল ভোটদাতা। এটা খুবই ভালো পরিবর্তন। কিন্তু কেবলমাত্র নির্বাচন কমিশন কাজ করবেন, এটা চলবে না। আমাদেরও স্কুল, কলেজ, পাড়ায়-পাড়ায় সচেতনতার পরিবেশ সৃষ্টি করতে হবে। কেবলমাত্র নির্বাচনের সময়ই সচেতন হলে চলবে না। সময়ে সময়ে ভোটার তালিকা সংশোধনের দিকে আমাদের নজর দিতে হবে। আমি যে মূল্যবান অধিকার পেয়েছি, সেই অধিকার সুরক্ষিত আছে কি নেই, বা আমি তার সঠিক প্রয়োগ করছি কিনা – সেদিকে আমাদের সজাগ নজর রাখতে হবে। আমি আশা করছি দেশের নব্যযুবকরা ভোটার তালিকায় তাঁদের নাম নথিভুক্ত না করে থাকলে অবশ্যই তাঁরা তা নথিভুক্ত করবেন এবং অবশ্যই ভোটদান করবেন। আমি তো নির্বাচনের দিন খোলাখুলি বলি ‘প্রথমে ভোটদান, তারপর জলপান’। এটা একটা পবিত্র কর্তব্য, সবারই করা উচিৎ।\nগত পরশু আমি কাশী ঘুরে এসেছি। অনেক লোকের সঙ্গে মিলিত হয়েছি, অনেক অনুষ্ঠান হয়েছে, অনেকের সঙ্গে সাক্ষাৎ হয়েছে, কিন্তু দু’জন বালক-এর কথা আমি আপনাদের বলতে চাই। একজন বালক – ক্ষিতিজ পাণ্ডে, যে বেনারস হিন্দু বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে অন্তর্ভুক্ত কেন্দ্রিয় বিদ্যালয়ের সপ্তম শ্রেণির ছাত্র, প্রাণচঞ্চল, প্রচণ্ড আত্মবিশ্বাসী। কিন্তু এত কম বয়সে পদার্থবিদ্যা গবেষণায় তার আগ্রহ আমাকে অবাক করেছে। আমার মনে হয়, ও অনেক পড়াশোনা করে, ইন্টারনেট সার্ফিং করে, বিজ্ঞানের নতুন নতুন ব্যবহার সম্পর্কে অবহিত। রেল দুর্ঘটনা থেকে কীভাবে রেহাই পাওয়া যায়, কী ধরনের প্রযুক্তি দরকার, শক্তির খরচ কীভাবে কম করা যায়, রোবটের অনুভূতি কীভাবে আসে ইত্যাদি বিভিন্ন বিষয় নিয়ে সে কথা বলছিল। সত্যিই আশ্চর্যজনক ছেলে। ওর কথাবার্তা সূক্ষ্মভাবে বিচার করতে পারিনি। কিন্তু তার আত্মবিশ্বাস, তার আগ্রহ দেখার মতো এবং আমিও চাই, আমাদের দেশের ছাত্র-ছাত্রীদের বিজ্ঞানের প্রতি আকর্ষণ বাড়া দরকার। এদের মনে প্রশ্ন ওঠা দরকার – কি, কেন, কখন ইত্যাদির। এটা সরল মনে জিজ্ঞাসা করা দরকার। এরকমই একজন সোনম্‌ প্যাটেল নামে এক ছোটো বালিকার সঙ্গে সাক্ষাৎ হয়েছে। সোনমের বয়স ন’বছর। বেনারসের সুন্দরপুর নিবাসী সদাবৃত প্যাটেলের কন্যা, খুবই দরিদ্র পরিবারের মেয়ে। আমি আশ্চর্য হয়ে গেলাম, পুরো গীতা মেয়েটির কণ্ঠস্থ। কিন্তু সব থেকে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ব্যাপার হল, আমি যখন তাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করলাম, সে শ্লোক বলে ইংরেজিতে তর্জমা করছিল, শ্লোকের ব্যাখ্যাও করছিল, হিন্দিতেও বিশ্লেষণ করে শুনিয়েছিল। আমি তার বাবাকে জিজ্ঞেস করাতে উনি বললেন, পাঁচ বছর বয়স থেকেই মেয়েটি এই কাজ করছে। এটা সে কোথা থেকে শিখেছে জিজ্ঞেস করাতে তার বাবা বললেন, তিনিও জানেন না। আমি তার পড়াশোনার কথা জিজ্ঞেস করলাম, সে কি কেবল গীতা-ই পড়ে না আরও কিছু করে? ভদ্রলোক বললেন, না সোনম্‌ যদি একবার অঙ্ক শুরু করে সন্ধের মধ্যে সব পাঠ শেষ, আর যদি ইতিহাস পড়ে, তো সন্ধের মধ্যে মুখস্থ। মেয়েকে নিয়ে তারাও বিস্মিত, পরিবারের মধ্যে সেই কেবল মাত্র এত সব পারে। আমি সত্যিই অভিভূত। কখনো কখনো বাচ্চাদের মধ্যে সেলিব্রিটি হওয়ার শখ জাগে। সোনমের মধ্যে এসব কিছুই ছিল না। আমার মনে হয়, ভগবান একে বিশেষ কোনো শক্তি প্রদান করেছেন। আমার কাশী যাত্রায় এই দুই বাচ্চার সঙ্গে সাক্ষাৎ গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল, তাই মনে হল আপনাদেরও এদের কথা বলি। আপনারা টিভিতে যা সব দেখেন, খবরের কাগজে যা পড়েন, তার অতিরিক্ত অনেক কাজ আমরা করি, কখনো কখনো এরকম কাজে আনন্দও পাই, এই দুই বালক-বালিকার সঙ্গে আমার কথাবার্তা আমার কাছে স্মরণীয় হয়ে থাকবে।\nআমি দেখেছি, ‘মন কি বাত’ অনুষ্ঠানে কিছু লোক আমার জন্য কিছু কাজ নিয়ে আসছেন, দেখুন, হরিয়ানার সন্দীপ কি বলছেন –\n“হরিয়ানা থেকে সন্দীপ বলছি, স্যার আমি চাই আপনি মন কি বাত অনুষ্ঠান যেটা মাসে একবার করছেন, অনুষ্ঠানটি সপ্তাহে একবার হওয়ার দরকার। কেননা আপনার কথা থেকে আমরা অনেক অনুপ্রেরণা লাভ করি।”\nসন্দীপজী, আপনারা আমাকে দিয়ে আর কি কি করাবেন? মাসে একবার এই অনুষ্ঠান করার জন্য আমাকে অনেক চেষ্টা করে সময় বের করতে হয়। কখনও কখনও আমাদের আকাশবাণীর বন্ধুদের আধঘণ্টা, পৌনে এক ঘণ্টা আমার জন্য অপেক্ষা করে বসে থাকতে হয়। কিন্তু আমি আপনার এই ভাবনাকে সম্মান জানাই। আপনার প্রস্তাবের জন্য কৃতজ্ঞতা জানাই, আপাতত মাসে একবারই ঠিক আছে। ‘মন কি বাত’ অনুষ্ঠানের এক বছর পূর্ণ হলো। আপনারা জানেন, সুভাষবাবু রেডিওর কতটা সদ্‌ব্যবহার করতেন? জার্মানি থেকে উনি নিজের রেডিও সম্প্রচার শুরু করেছিলেন, আর রেডিওর মাধ্যমে ভারতবর্ষের জনগণকে স্বাধীনতার আন্দোলন সম্বন্ধে বারবার বলতেন। সাপ্তাহিক সংবাদ বুলেটিন দিয়ে উনি আজাদ হিন্দ রেডিও-র সূচনা করেছিলেন। ইংরেজি, হিন্দি, বাংলা, মারাঠি, পাঞ্জাবী, পুস্তু, উর্দু প্রভৃতি ভাষায় এই রেডিও সম্প্রচার হত।\nআকাশবাণীতে ‘মন কি বাত’ অনুষ্ঠান করতে করতে এক বছর পার হয়ে গেলো, আমার মনের কথা আপনাদের জন্য সত্যি সত্যিই আপনাদের মনের কথা হয়ে গেছে। আপনাদের কথা শুনি, আপনাদের জন্য ভাবি, আপনাদের প্রস্তাব বিবেচনা করি, আর তার থেকেই আমার চিন্তাধারার দিগন্ত খুলে যায়, যা আকাশবাণীর মাধ্যমে আপনাদের কাছে পৌঁছায়। আমি বলি, কিন্তু এটা আসলে আপনাদেরই কথা, আর এতেই আমার সন্তুষ্টি।\nআগামী মাসে ‘মন কি বাত’ অনুষ্ঠানে আবার কথা হবে, আপনাদের প্রস্তাব পাঠাতে থাকবেন, প্রস্তাবগুলো থেকে সরকারও উপকৃত হয়। সংশোধনের শুরু হয়।\nআপনাদের অংশগ্রহণ আমার জন্য মূল্যবান, আপনাদের সবাইকে আর একবার অনেক অনেক শুভেচ্ছা, ধন্যবাদ!\n"

        "article": "\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ,\nઆપ સહુને નમસ્કાર. ‘મન કી બાત’નો આ બારમો હપ્તો છે. અને આ રીતે જોઈએ તો એક વર્ષ વિતી ગયું. ગયા વર્ષે ત્રણ ઑક્ટોબરે પહેલીવાર મને મનની વાત કરવાનું સૌભાગ્ય મળ્યું હતું. ‘મન કી બાત’ … એક વર્ષ … અનેક વાતો… મને નથી ખબર કે તમે શું મેળવ્યું. પરંતુ હું એટલું જરૂર કરી શકું કે મેં ઘણું મેળવ્યું છે. લોકતંત્રમાં જનશક્તિનું ખૂબ જ મહત્વ છે. મારા જીવનમાં એક મૂળભૂત વિચાર રહ્યો છે અને તેના કારણે જનશક્તિ પર મારો અપાર વિશ્વાસ રહ્યો છે પરંતુ ‘મનની વાત’એ મને જે શીખવ્યું, જે સમજાવ્યું, જે જાણ્યું, જે અનુભવ કર્યો તેનાથી હું કહી શકું છું કે આપણે વિચારીએ છીએ તેનાથી પણ વધુ જનશક્તિ અપરંપાર હોય છે. આપણા પૂર્વજ કહેતા હતા કે જનતા જનાર્દન એ ઈશ્વરનો જ અંશ હોય છે.\nહું ‘મન કી બાત’ના મારા અનુભવોથી કહી શકું છું કે આપણા પૂર્વજોના વિચારમાં બહુ મોટી શક્તિ છે, બહુ મોટી સચ્ચાઈ છે, કારણ કે મેં એ અનુભવ્યું છે કે ‘મનની વાત’ માટે હું સૂચનો માગતો હતો અને દર વખતે બે કે ચાર સૂચનો પર જ વાત કરી શકતો હતો પરંતુ લાખોની સંખ્યામાં લોકો સક્રિય થઈ મને સૂચનો આપતા રહેતા હતા, આ એક બહુ મોટી શક્તિ છે. નહિતર વડાપ્રધાનને સંદેશ આપ્યો, માય ગવ ડોટ ઇન પર લખી દીધું, મેઇલ કરી દીધો, કાગળ લખી દીધો, પરંતુ એક વાર પણ આપણું સૂચન આવ્યું નહિ, રેડિયો પર આવ્યું નહિ તો કોઈ પણ વ્યક્તિ નિરાશ થઈ શકે. પરંતુ મને એવું નથી લાગ્યું. હા, મને આ લાખો પત્રોએ મોટો બોધપાઠ પણ આપ્યો. સરકારની અનેક મુશ્કેલીઓ, સમસ્યાઓ વિશે મને જાણકારી મળતી રહી. અને હું આકાશવાણીને પણ અભિનંદન આપું છું કે તેણે આ સૂચનોને માત્ર પત્ર ન ગણ્યા અને સામાન્ય માનવીની આકાંક્ષા ગણી અને તેણે તે પછી કાર્યક્રમો કર્યા. સરકારના વિવિધ વિભાગોને આકાશવાણી પર બોલાવ્યા અને જનતા જનાર્દને જે વાતો કહી હતી તેને તેમની સામે રાખી કેટલીક સમસ્યાઓનું નિરાકરણ કરવા પ્રયાસ કર્યો. સરકારના અલગ-અલગ વિભાગોએ લોકોના પત્રોનું વિશ્લેષણ કર્યું અને એ કઈ વાતો છે જે નીતિની બાબત છે. એ કઈ વાત છે જે વ્યક્તિલક્ષી પ્રશ્ન છે, એ કઈ વાત છે જે સરકારના ધ્યાનમાં જ નથી. ઘણી વાતો જમીનના સ્તરથી સરકાર પાસે આવવા લાગી અને એ વાત સાચી છે કે પ્રશાસનનો એક મૂળભૂત સિદ્ધાંત છે કે જાણકારી નીચેથી ઉપર તરફ આવવી જોઈ અને માર્ગદર્શન ઉપરથી નીચેની તરફ જવું જોઈએ. આ જાણકારીઓનો સ્રોત ‘મનની વાત’ બની જશે, એ કોણે વિચાર્યું હતું ? પરંતુ તે થઈ ગયું.\nઅને આ જ રીતે ‘મનની વાત’ એ સમાજ શક્તિની અભિવ્યક્તિનો અવસર આપી દીધો. મેં એક દિવસ એમ જ કહી દીધું હતું કે, ‘સેલ્ફી વીથ ડૉટર’ અને આખી દુનિયા આશ્ચર્યમાં પડી ગઈ. કદાચ દુનિયાના બધા દેશોમાં કોઈ ને કોઈએ લાખોની સંખ્યામાં ‘સેલ્ફી વીથ ડૉટર’, અને દિકરીને શું ગરીમા મળી ગઈ. અને જ્યારે તે ‘સેલ્ફી વીથ ડૉટર’ કરતા હતા ત્યારે તે પોતાની દિકરીનો ઉત્સાહ વધારતો જ હતો પરંતુ પોતાની અંદર પણ પ્રતિબદ્ધતા પેદા કરતો હતો. જ્યારે લોકો જોતા હતા ત્યારે પણ લાગતું હતું કે દિકરીઓ પ્રત્યેની ઉપેક્ષા હવે ત્યજવી પડશે. એક મૌન ક્રાંતિ હતી.\nભારતના પર્યટનને ધ્યાનમાં રાખતા મેં એમ જ નાગરિકોને કહ્યું હતું ‘ઇન્ક્રેડિબલ ઇન્ડિયા’ કે ભી તમે પણ જતા હો, જો કોઈ સારી તસવીર હોય તો મોકલજો, હું જોઈશ. આમ બધી સામાન્ય-હળવી વાતો હતી. પરંતુ કેટલું મોટું પરિવર્તન આવ્યું. લાખોની સંખ્યામાં ભારતના દરેક ખૂણાની એવી એવી તસવીર લોકોએ મોકલી, કદાચ ભારત સરકારના પર્યટન વિભાગે, રાજ્ય સરકારના પર્યટન વિભાગે ક્યારેય વિચાર્યું પણ નહિ હોય કે આપણી પાસે આવો સુંદર વારસો છે. એક મંચ પર બધી ચીજો આવી અને સરકારનો એક રૂપિયો પણ ખર્ચાયો નહિ. લોકોએ સુંદર કામ કર્યું. મને ખુશી તો ત્યારે થઈ જ્યારે ગત વર્ષના ઑક્ટોબર મહિનામાં મારી પહેલી ‘મનની વાત’ હતી તો મેં ગાંધીજ્યંતિનો ઉલ્લેખ કર્યો હતો અને લોકોને પ્રાર્થના કરી હતી કે બે ઑક્ટોબર મહાત્મા ગાંધીની જ્યંતિ આપણે મનાવી રહ્યા છીએ. એક સમય હતો ‘ખાદી ફોર નેશન’. શું હવે સમયની માગ નથી કે ‘ખાદી ફોર ફેશન’ ? અને લોકોને મેં આગ્રહ કર્યો હતો કે, આપ ખાદી ખરીદો. થોડું યોગદાન આપો. આજે હું ઘણા સંતોષ સાથે કહું છું કે ગયા એક વર્ષમાં ખાદીનું વેચાણ લગભગ બમણું થયું છે, હવે આ કામ કંઈ સરકારી જાહેરખબરના કારણે નથી થયું. અબજો રૂપિયા ખર્ચીને નથી થયું. જનશક્તિનો એક અહેસાસ, એક અનુભૂતિ, એક વાર મેં ‘મનની વાત’ માં કહ્યું હતું ગરીબના ઘરમાં ચૂલો બળે છે, બાળકો રોતા રહે છે, ગરીબ માતા, શું તેને ગેસ-બાટલો ન મળવો જોઈએ ? અને મેં સંપન્ન લોકોને પ્રાર્થના કરી હતી કે તમે સબસિડી ત્યજી ન શકો શું ? વિચારો… અને આજ હું ઘણા આનંદ સાથે કહેવા માગુ છું કે આ દેશના ત્રીસ લાખ પરિવારોએ ગેસ-બાટલાની સબસિડી ત્યજી દીધી છે. અને આ લોકો પાછા અમીર નથી ! એક ટીવી ચેનલ પર મેં જોયું હતું કે, એક નિવૃત્ત શિક્ષક, એક વિધવા મહિલા લાઇનમાં ઊભી હતી, સબસિડી છોડવા માટે. સમાજના સામાન્ય જન મધ્યમ વર્ગ, નિમ્ન મધ્યમ વર્ગ જેના માટે સબસિડી છોડવી મુશ્કેલ કામ છે, પરંતુ આવા લોકોએ છોડી. શું આ મૌન ક્રાંતિ નથી ? શું આ જનશક્તિનું દર્શન નથી ?\nસરકારોએ પણ બોધપાઠ શીખવો પડશે કે આપણા સરકારી કાર્યાલયોમાં જે કામ થાય છે તે ઉંબરાની બહાર એક ઘણી મોટી જનશક્તિનો એક સામર્થ્યવાન, ઊર્જાવાન અને સંકલ્પવાન સમાજ છે. સરકારો જેટલી સમાજ સાથે જોડાઈને ચાલે છે એટલી વધુ સમાજમાં પરિવર્તન માટે એક ઉદ્દીપકના રૂપમાં કામ કરી શકે છે. ‘મનની વાત’ માં મને જે બધી ચીજો પર ભરોસો હતો પરંતુ આજે તે વિશ્વાસમાં પરિવર્તિત થઈ ગયો, શ્રદ્ધામાં રૂપાંતરિત થયો અને આથી હું આજે ‘મનની વાત’ના માધ્યમથી ફરી એકવાર જનશક્તિને શત્ શત્ વંદન કરું છું, નમન કરવા ચાહું છું. દરેક નાની વાતને પોતાની બનાવી અને દેશની ભલાઈ માટે પોતાને જોડવા પ્રયાસ કર્યો. આનાથી મોટો સંતોષ શું હોઈ શકે છે ?\n‘મન કી બાત’માં આ વખતે મેં એક નવો પ્રયોગ કરવાનું વિચાર્યું. મેં દેશના નાગરિકોને પ્રાર્થના કરી હતી કે, આપ ટેલિફોન કરીને તમારા પ્રશ્નો-તમારા સૂચનો નોંધાવો. હું ‘મનની વાત’માં તેના પર ધ્યાન આપીશ. મને ખુશી છે કે, દેશમાંથી લગભગ પંચાવન હજારથી વધુ ફોન કોલ્સ આવ્યા. પછી સિયાચીન હોય, કચ્છ યા કામરૂપ, પછી કશ્મીર હોય કે કન્યાકુમારી, હિન્દુસ્તાનનો એવો કોઈ ખૂણો નહિ હોય જ્યાંથી લોકોએ ફોન કોલ્સ ન કર્યા હોય. આ ઘણો સુખદ અનુભવ છે. બધી વયના લોકોએ સંદેશ આપ્યા છે. કેટલાક સંદેશ મેં પોતે સાંભળવાનું પસંદ કર્યું. મને સારું લાગ્યું. બાકીના પર મારી ટીમ કામ કરી રહી છે. તમે ભલે એક મિનિટ કે બે મિનિટ કાઢી હશે પણ મારા માટે તમારા ફોન કોલ, તમારો સંદેશ ખૂબ જ મહત્વનો છે. સંપૂર્ણ સરકાર તમારાં સૂચનો પર જરૂર કામ કરશે. પણ એક વાત મારા માટે આશ્ચર્યની રહી અને આનંદની રહી. આમ તો એવું લાગે છે કે જાણે ચારો તરફ નેગેટિવીટી છે, નકારાત્મકતા છે. પરંતુ મારો અનુભવ અલગ રહ્યો. આ પંચાવન હજાર લોકોએ પોતાની રીતે પોતાની વાત કહેવાની હતી. કોઈ રોકટોક નહોતી. કંઈ પણ કહી શકતા હતા. પણ મને આશ્ચર્ય થાય છે કે બધી વાતો એવી જ હતી જેવી ‘મનની વાત’ ની છાયામાં હો… સંપૂર્ણપણે સકારાત્મક, સૂચનાત્મક, સર્જનાત્મક. એટલે જુઓ દેશનો સામાન્ય નાગરિક પણ હકારાત્મક વિચાર સાથે ચાલી રહ્યો છે. આ તો કેટલી મોટી મૂડી છે દેશની. કદાચ એક ટકા કે બે ટકા જ ફોન એવા હશે જેમાં કોઈ ગંભીર પ્રકારની ફરિયાદ હોય. બાકી 90 ટકાથી પણ વધુ એક ઊર્જા ભરનારી, આનંદ આપનારી વાતો લોકોએ કહી છે.\nએક વાત મારા ધ્યાનમાં આવી – ખાસ કરીને સ્પેશિયલી એબલ્ડ (વિશેષ સામર્થ્યવાન) – તેમાં પણ ખાસ કરીને દૃષ્ટિહીન સ્વજનો – તેમના ઘણા ફોન આવ્યા છે. પરંતુ તેનું કારણ એ હશે કદાચ તેઓ ટીવી જોઈ શકતા નથી. તેઓ રેડિયો જરૂર સાંભળતા હશે. દૃષ્ટિહીન લોકો માટે રેડિયો કેટલો બધો મહત્વનો હશે તે મને આ વાતથી ધ્યાનમાં આવ્યું. એક નવો આયામ્ હું જોઈ રહ્યો છું અને એટલી સારી સારી વાતો કહી છે. આ લોકોએ અને સરકારને પણ સંવેદનશીલ બનાવવા માટે પર્યાપ્ત છે. મને અલવર રાજસ્થાનથી પવન આચાર્ય એ એક સંદેશ આપ્યો છું. હું માનું છું કે પવન આચાર્યની. વાત સમગ્ર દેશે સાંભળવી જોઈએ. અને સમગ્ર દેશે માનવી જોઈએ. સાંભળો તેઓ શું કહેવા માગે છે – જરૂર સાંભળો –\n‘મારું નામ પવન આચાર્ય છે અને હું અલવર રાજસ્થાનનો છું. મારો સંદેશ વડાપ્રધાનશ્રી નરેન્દ્ર મોદીજીને એ છે કે કૃપા કરીને આપ આ વખતે ‘મનની વાત’ માં સમગ્ર ભારત દેશની જનતાને આહવાન કરો કે દિવાળી પર તે વધુમાં વધુ માટીના દીવડાઓનો ઉપયોગ કરે જેથી પર્યાવરણને તો લાભ થશે જ અને હજારો કુંભાર ભાઈઓને રોજગારીની તક મળશે… ધન્યવાદ..’\nપવન મને વિશ્વાસ છે કે પવનની જેમ આપની ભાવના હિન્દુસ્તાનના દરેક ખૂણામાં જરૂર પહોંચશે, ફેલાશે. સારું સૂચન કર્યું છે, માટીનું તો મૂલ જ ન થાય અને આથી માટીના દીવડાઓ પણ અણમોલ હોય છે. પર્યાવરણની દૃષ્ટિથી પણ તેનું મહત્વ છે. અને દીવડો બને છે ગરીબના ઘરમાં. નાના નાના લોકો આ કામથી પોતાનું પેટ ભરે છે અને હું દેશવાસીઓને જરૂર કહું છું કે આવનારા તહેવારોમાં પવન આચાર્યની વાત જો આપણે માનીશું તો તેનો અર્થ એ છે કે દીવડો આપણા ઘરમાં પ્રગટશે પણ તેનો પ્રકાશ ગરીબના ઘરમાં થશે. મારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, ગણેશ ચતુર્થીના દિવસે મને સેનાના જવાનો સાથે બે-ત્રણ કલાક વિતાવવાનો અવસર મળ્યો. જળ, થલ અને નભ સુરક્ષા કરનારી આપણી નૌ-સેના હોય, ભૂમિ દળ હોય, વાયુ સેના હોય – આર્મી, એર ફોર્સ, નેવી. 1965નું જે યુદ્ધ થયું હતું, પાકિસ્તાન સાથે તેને 50 વર્ષ પૂરાં થયાં. તે નિમિત્તે દિલ્હીમાં ઇંડિયા ગેટ પાસે એક શૌર્યાંજલિ પ્રદર્શનીની રચના કરી છે. હું તેને ભાવથી જોતા રહ્યા ગયો હતો તો અડધા કલાક માટે પરંતુ પજ્યારે નીકળ્યો તો અઢી કલાક થઈ ગયો અને તેમ છતાં કંઈક છૂટી ગયું. ત્યાં શું નહોતું ? સમગ્ર ઇતિહાસને જીવંત કરી દીધો છે. સૌંદર્યની દૃષ્ટિથી જુઓ તો પણ ઉત્તમ છે. ઇતિહાસની દૃષ્ટિથી જુઓ તો ઘણું શીખવા મળે. અને જીવનમાં પ્રેરણા માટે જુઓ તો કદાચ માતૃભૂમિની સેવા કરવા માટે આનાથી મોટી તો કોઈ પ્રેરણા હોઈ ન શકે. યુદ્ધની જે ગૌરવભરી ક્ષણો અને આપણા સૈનિકોના અદમ્ય સાહસ અને બલિદાન વિશે આપણે સાંભળતા હતા તે વખતે તો તેની તસવીરો પ્રાપ્ય નહોતી, આટલી વિડિયોગ્રાફી પણ થતી નહોતી. આ પ્રદર્શનીના માધ્યમથી તેની અનુભૂતિ થાય છે.\nલડાઈ હાજીપીરની હોય, અસલ ઉત્તરની હોય, ચામિંડાની હોય અને હાજીપીર પાસે જીતનાં દૃશ્યોને જોઈએ તો રોમાંચ થાય છે અને આપણી સેનાના જવાનો પ્રત્યે ગર્વ થાય છે. મારો આ વીર પરિવારો સાથે પણ મળવાનું થયું તે બલિદાની પરિવારો સાથે પણ મળવાનું થયું અને યુદ્ધમાં જે લોકોએ ભાગ લીધો હતો તેઓ પણ હવે જીવનના ઉત્તર કાળખંડમાં છે. તેઓ પણ પહોંચ્યા હતા અને જ્યારે તેમની સાથે હાથ મેળવી રહ્યો હતો તો લાગ્યું કે વાહ, શું ઊર્જા છે. તે એક પ્રેરણા આપતો હતો. જો તમે ઇતિહાસ બનાવવા ઇચ્છતા હો તો ઇતિહાસને ઊંડાણથી સમજવો જરૂરી છે. ઇતિહાસ આપણને આપણનાં ઇતિહાસ બનાવવાની સંભાવનાઓ પર પણ પૂર્ણવિરામ લાગી જાય છે. આ શૌર્ય પ્રદર્શનીના માધ્યમથી ઇતિહાસની અનુભૂતિ થાય છે. ઇતિહાસની જાણકારી મળે છે. અને નવો ઇતિહાસ બનાવવાની પ્રેરણાનાં બીજ પણ વાવી શકાય છે. હું આપને આપના પરિવારજનોને – જો આપ દિલ્લીની આસપાસ હો – કદાચ પ્રદર્શની હજુ કેટલાક દિવસો ચાલનારી છે – આપ જરૂર જોજો અને ઉતાવળ ન કરતા મારી જેમ. હું તો અઢી કલાકમાં પાછો આવી ગયો પરંતુ આપને તો ત્રણ-ચાર કલાક જરૂર લાગી જશે – જરૂર જુઓ.\nલોકતંત્રની તાકાત જુઓ. એક નાનકડા બાળકે વડાપ્રધાનને આદેશ કર્યો છે, પરંતુ તે બાળક ઉતાવળમાં પોતાનું નામ કહેવાનું ભૂલી ગયો છે. તો મારી પાસે તેનું નામ નથી પરંતુ તેની વાત પર વડાપ્રધાને ધ્યાન આપવા જેવું છે પરંતુ આપણે બધા દેશવાસીઓએ પણ ધ્યાન આપવા જેવું છે. સાંભળો આ બાળક આપણને શું કહે છે ? –\n‘વડાપ્રધાન મોદીજી, હું આપને કહેવા માગું છું કે આપે જે સ્વચ્છતા અભિયાન ચલાવ્યું છે તેના માટે આપ દરેક જગ્યાએ દરેક ગલીમાં કચરાપેટી (ડસ્ટબીન) મૂકાવો.\nઆ બાળકે સાચું કહ્યું કે. આપણે સ્વચ્છતાનો સ્વભાવ પણ બનાવવો જોઈએ અને સ્વચ્છતા માટે વ્યવસ્થા પણ બનાવવી જોઈએ. મને આ બાળકના સંદેશથી એક ઘણો સંતોષ મળ્યો. સંતોષ એ વાતનો મળ્યો કે બે ઑક્ટોબરે મેં સ્વચ્છતા અભિયાન ચલાવવાની ઘોષણા કરી અને હું કહી શકું છું. કદાચ સ્વતંત્રતા પછી પહેલીવાર એવું થયું હશે કે સંસદમાં પણ કલાકો સુધી સ્વચ્છતાના વિષય પર આજકાલ ચર્ચા થાય છે. અમારી સરકારની ટીકા પણ થાય છે. મારે પણ ઘણું સાંભળવું પડે છે. કે મોદીજી મોટી મોટી વાતો કરો છે પણ શું થયું ? હું તેને ખરાબ નથી માનતો. હું તેમાંથી સારી વાત એ જોઉં છું કે દેશની સંસદ પણ ભારતની સ્વચ્છતા માટે ચર્ચા કરી રહી છે. અને બીજી તરફ જુઓ એક તરફ સંસદ અને એક તરફ આ દેશનો શિશુ – બંને સ્વચ્છતા પર વાત કરે છે – આનાથી મોટું દેશનું સૌભાગ્ય શું હોય શકે છે ? આ જે આંદોલન ચાલી રહ્યું છે વિચારોનું – ગંદકી તરફ નફરતનું જે વાતાવરણ બની રહ્યું છે – સ્વચ્છતા પ્રત્યે જાગૃતિ આવી છે – તે સરકારોને પણ કામ કરવામ માટે ફરજ પાડશે, પાડશે અને પાડશે જ. સ્થાનિક સ્વરાજની સંસ્થાઓને પણ પછી તે પંચાયત હોય – નગર પંચાયત હોય – નગર પાલિકા હોય – મહાનગરપાલિકા હોય કે પછી રાજ્ય કે કેન્દ્ર હોય – બધાને તેના પર કામ કરવું જ પડશે. આ આંદોલનને આપણે આગળ વધારવાનું છે. ઉણપો હોય તો પણ આગળ વધારવાનું છે અને આ ભારતને, 2019માં, જ્યારે મહાત્મા ગાંધીની 150મી જ્યંતિ આપણે મનાવીશું, મહાત્મા ગાંધીનાં સપનાંને પૂરાં કરવાની દિશામાં આપણે કામ કરીએ, અને આપને ખબર છે – મહાત્મા ગાંધી શું કહેતા હતા ? એક વાર તેમણે કહ્યું હતું – સ્વતંત્રતા અને સ્વચ્છતા બેમાંથી એક મારે પસંદ કરવાનું હોય તો હું પહેલાં સ્વચ્છતા પસંદ કરીશ, સ્વતંત્રતા પછી ગાંધી માટે સ્વતંત્રતાથી પણ વધુ મહત્વ સ્વચ્છતાનું હતું. આવો આપણે બધા મહાત્મા ગાંધીની વાતને માનીએ અને તેમની ઇચ્છાઓને પૂરી કરવા થોડાંક ડગલાં આપણે પણ ચાલીએ. દિલ્લીથી ગુલશન અરોડાજીએ માય ગવ પર એક સંદેશ મૂક્યો છે. તેમણે લખ્યું છે કે દીનદયાળજીની જન્મશતાબ્દી વિશે તેઓ જાણવા માગે છે.\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, મહાપુરુષોનું જીવન સદા સર્વદા આપણા માટે પ્રેરણાનું કારણ રહે છે. અને આપણું કામ મહાપુરુષ કઈ વિચારધારાના હતા તેનું મૂલ્યાંકન કરવું એ આપણું કામ નથી. દેશ માટે જીવનારા-મરનારા દરેક આપણા માટે પ્રેરક હોય છે અને આ દિવસોમાં એટલા બધા મહાપુરુષોને યાદ કરવાના પ્રસંગો આવી રહ્યા છે – 25 સપ્ટેમ્બરે પંડિત દીનદયાળ ઉપાધ્યાય, 2 ઑક્ટોબરે મહાત્મા ગાંધી, લાલબહાદુર શાસ્ત્રી, 11 ઑક્ટોબરે જયપ્રકાશ નારાયણજી, 31 ઑક્ટોબરે સરદાર વલ્લભભાઈ પટેલ, કેટલાં અગણિત નામો છે. હું તો થોડાંક જ બોલી રહ્યો છું, કારણ કે આ દેશ તો બહુરત્ના વસુંધરા છે. આપ કોઈ પણ તારીખ કાઢો, ઇતિહાસના ઝરૂખામાંથી કોઈ ને કોઈ મહાપુરૂષનું નામ તો મળી જ જશે. આવનારા દિવસોમાં આ બધા મહાપુરુષોને આપણે યાદ કરીએ, તેમના જીવનનો સંદેશ આપણે ઘર-ઘર સુધી પહોંચાડીએ, અને આપણે પણ તેમાંથી કંઈ ને કંઈ શીખવાનો પ્રયાસ કરીએ.\nહું વિશેષ રૂપે 2 ઑક્ટોબર માટે ફરી એક વાર આગ્રહ કરવા માગું છું. 2 ઑક્ટોબર પૂજ્ય બાપુ મહાત્મા ગાંધીની જન્મજ્યંતિ છે. મેં ગયા વર્ષે પણ કહ્યું હતું કે, તમારી પાસે દરેક પ્રકારની ફેશનનાં વસ્ત્રો હશે, દરેક પ્રકારનું ફેબ્રિક હશે, ઘણી ચીજો હશે પરંતુ તેમાં એક ખાદીનું પણ સ્થાન હોવું જોઈએ. હું એકવાર ફરી કહું છુ કે, 2 ઑક્ટોબરથી લઈને એક મહિના સુધી ખાદીમાં છૂટ હોય છે. તેનો ફાયદો ઉઠાવવો જોઈએ. અને ખાદીની સાથે હેન્ડલૂમને પણ એટલું જ મહત્વ આપવું જોઈએ. આપણા વણકર ભાઈ કેટલી મહેનત કરે છે ? આપણે સવા સો કરોડ દેશવાસી પાંચ રૂપિયા, દસ રૂપિયા, પચાસ રૂપિયાની પણ કોઈ હેન્ડલૂમની ચીજ, કોઈ ખાદીની ચીજ ખરીદી લઈએ, છેવટે એ પૈસા ગરીબ વણકરના ઘરમાં જશે. ખાદી બનાવનારી ગરીબ વિધવાના ઘરમાં જશે. અને આથી આ દિવાળીમાં આપણે ખાદીને જરૂર આપણાં ઘરમાં સ્થાન આપીએ, આપણા શરીર પર સ્થાન આપીએ. હું એવો આગ્રહ નથી કરતો કે તમે પૂર્ણરીતે ખાદીધારી બનો. માત્ર થોડુંક – આટલો જ આગ્રહ છે મારો. અને જુઓ ગયા વખતે વેચાણ લગભગ બમણું કરી દીધું. કેટલા ગરીબોને ફાયદો થયો છે. જે કામ સરકાર અબજો રૂપિયાની જાહેરખબરથી કરી નથી શકતી, તે તમે લોકોએ નાનકડી મદદથી કરી દીધી. આ જ તો જનશક્તિ છે અને આથી હું ફરી એકવાર આ કામ માટે તમને આગ્રહ કરું છું.\nવ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, મારા મનમાં એક વાતથી બહુ આનંદ છે. મન થાય છે આ આનંદનો તમને પણ થોડો સ્વાદ મળવો જોઈએ. હું મે મહિનામાં કોલકાતા ગયો હતો. મને સુભાષચંદ્ર બોઝના પરિવારજનો મળવા આવ્યા હતા. તેમના ભત્રીજા ચંદ્રા બોઝે બધું આયોજન કર્યું હતું. ઘણા સમય સુધી સુભાષબાબુના પરિવારજનો સાથે આનંદ ઉલ્લાસવાળી સાંજ વિતાવવાની મને તક મળી હતી. અને એ દિવસે એવું નક્કી કરાવ્યું હતું કે સુભાષબાબુનો બૃહદ પરિવાર વડાપ્રધાન નિવાસ સ્થાને આવે. ચંદ્રા બોઝ અને તેના પરિવારજનો આ કામમાં લાગી ગયા અને ગયા સપ્તાહે મને કન્ફર્મેશન મળ્યું કે 50 થી વધુ સુભાષ બાબુના પરિવારજનો વડાપ્રધાનના નિવાસ સ્થાન પર આવવાના છે. તમે કલ્પના કરી શકો છો કે મારા માટે કેટલી ખુશીની પળ હશે ? નેતાજીના પરિવારજન કદાચ તેમના જીવનમાં પહેલીવાર બધા એક સાથે વડાપ્રધાન નિવાસ જવાનો પ્રસંગ આવ્યો હશે. પરંતુ તેનાથી વધુ મારા માટે ખુશીની વાત એ છે કે વડાપ્રધાન નિવાસ સ્થાનમાં આવા આતિથ્ય સત્કારનું સૌભાગ્ય ક્યારેય નહિ આવ્યું હોય. જે મને ઑક્ટોબરમાં મળનાર છે. સુભાષ બાબુના 50 થી વધુ અને સમગ્ર પરિવારના લોકો અલગ-અલગ દેશોમાં રહે છે. બધા લોકો ખાસ આવી રહ્યા છે. કેટલી મોટી આનંદની પળ હશે મારા માટે ? હું તેમના સ્વાગત માટે ખુશ છું. ઘણી આનંદની અનુભૂતિ કરી રહ્યો છું.\nએક સંદેશ મને ભાર્ગવી કાનડે તરફથી મળ્યો અને તેનો બોલવાનો ઢંગ, તેનો અવાજ આ બધું સાંભળીને મને એવું લાગ્યું કે તે પોતે જ લીડર લાગે છે અને કદાચ લીડર બનશે એવું લાગે છે.\n‘મારું નામ ભાર્ગવી કાનડે છે. હું વડાપ્રધાનજીને એવું નિવેદન કરવા માગું છું કે તમે યુવા પેઢીને વોટર રજિસ્ટ્રેશન વિશે જાગ્રત કરો જેથી આવનારા સમયમાં યુવા પેઢીની હિસ્સેદારી વધે અને ભવિષ્યમાં યુવા પેઢીના મહત્વપૂર્ણ સહયોગ સરકાર પસંદ કરવામાં અને ચલાવવામાં હોય. ધન્યવાદ…’\nભાર્ગવીએ કહ્યું છે કે મતદાર સૂચિમાં નામ રજિસ્ટર કરવાની વાત અને મતદાન કરવાની વાત. તમારી વાત સાચી છે. લોકતંત્રમાં દરેક મતદાતા દેશનો ભાગ્યવિધાતા હોય છે અને આ જાગૃતિ ધીરેધીરે વધી રહી છે. મતદાનની ટકાવારી પણ વધી રહી છે. અને હું આ માટે ભારતના ચૂંટણી પંચને વિશેષ રૂપે અભિનંદન આપવા માગું છું. કેટલાંક વર્ષો પહેલાં આપણે જોતા હતા કે આપણું ચૂંટણી પંચ એક માત્ર નિયંત્રક તરીકે કામ કરી રહ્યું છે પરંતુ ગત કેટલાંક વર્ષોમાં તેમાં મોટું પરિવર્તન આવ્યું છે. આજે આપણું ચૂંટણી પંચ માત્ર નિયંત્રક નથી રહ્યું એક રીતે સુવિધા આપનારું બની ગયું છે – મતદાર મિત્ર બની ગયું છે અને તેના બધા વિચાર-યોજનાઓમાં મતદાર કેન્દ્રમાં હોય છે. આ બહુ મોટું પરિવર્તન આવ્યું છે. પરંતુ માત્ર ચૂંટણી પંચ કામ કરતું રહે તેનાથી નહિ ચાલે.\nઆપણે પણ સ્કૂલમાં, કૉલેજમાં, શેરીઓમાં આ જાગ્રતિનું વાતાવરણ જાળવી રાખવું જોઈએ, માત્ર ચૂંટણી વખતે જ જાગૃતિ આવે એવું નહિ. મતદાર યાદી અપગ્રેડ થતી રહેવી જોઈએ. આપણે પણ ચકાસતા રહેવું જોઈએ. મને જે અમૂલ્ય અધિકાર મળ્યો છે તે સુરક્ષિત છે કે નહિ, હું અધિકારનો ઉપયોગ કરી રહ્યો છું કે નથી કરી રહ્યો – આ ટેવ બધાને ચાલુ રાખવી પડશે. હું આશા કરું છું દેશના નવયુવાનો જો મતદાર યાદીમાં રજિસ્ટર્ડ નથી થયા તો તેમણે થવું જોઈએ અને મતદાન પણ જરૂર કરવું જોઈએ. હું તો ચૂંટણીના સમયમાં કહું છું કે પહેલાં મતદાન પછી જળપાન. કેટલું પવિત્ર કામ છે, બધાએ કરવું જોઈએ.\nપરમ દિવસે હું કાશીનું ભ્રમણ કરીને આવ્યો. ઘણા લોકોને મળ્યો. ઘણા બધા કાર્યક્રમો થયા. એટલા બધા લોકોને મળ્યો પંરતુ બે બાળક – જેની વાત હું તમને કરવા માગું છું. એક મને ક્ષિતિજ પાંડે નામનો સાતમા ધોરણનો વિદ્યાર્થી મળ્યો. બનારસ હિન્દુ વિશ્વ વિદ્યાલયમાં કેન્દ્રીય વિદ્યાલયમાં તે સાતમા ધોરણાં ભણે છે. આમ તો તે ખૂબ જ તીક્ષ્ણ બુદ્ધિનો છે. તેનો આત્મવિશ્વાસ ગજબનો છે. પરંતુ આટલી નાની વયમાં ફિઝિક્સના સંશોધનોમાં તેમની રૂચિ મેં જોઈ. મને લાગ્યું કે તે ઘણું બધું વાંચતો હશે. ઇન્ટરનેટ સર્ફિંગ પણ કરતો હશે, નવા નવા પ્રયોગ જોતો હશે, રેલ અકસ્માતો કેવી રીતે રોકી શકાય, કઈ ટેકનોલોજી હોય, ઊર્જા પાછળ ખર્ચો કેવી રીતે ઓછો થાય. રોબોટ્સમાં સંવેદનાઓ કેવી રીતે આવે, શું-શું વાતો તે કહી રહ્યો હતો. બહુ ગજબ હતો તે ભાઈ. ખેર, હું ચોક્કસ રીતે તેની પ્રતિભામાં એ તો ન જોઈ શક્યો કે તે જે કહે છે તેમાં ચોક્સાઈ કેટલી છે, પરંતુ તેનો આત્મવિશ્વાસ, તેની રૂચિ, અને હું ઇચ્છુ છું કે, આપણા દેશનાં બાળકોની વિજ્ઞાન પ્રત્યે રૂચિ વધવી જોઈએ. બાળકના મનમાં સતત પ્રશ્નો થવા જોઈએ – કેમ ? કેવી રીતે ? ક્યારે ? આ બાળક મનને પૂછવો જોઈએ.\nઆ જ રીતે મને સોનમ પટેલ એક ઘણી જ નાનકડી બાળાને મળવાનું થયું. નવ વર્ષની વય છે. વારાણસીના સુંદરપુર નિવાસી સદાબ્રિજ પટેલની તે એક દીકરી ઘણા જ ગરીબ પરિવારની દીકરી છે અને મને આશ્ચર્ય થયું કે તે બાળા આખી ગીતા તેને કંઠસ્થ છે. પરંતુ સૌથી મોટી વાત મને એ લાગી કે જ્યારે મેં તેને પૂછ્યું તો તે શ્લોક પણ કહેતી હતી, અંગ્રેજીમાં અર્થઘટન કરતી હતી, તેની પરિભાષા કરતી હતી, હિન્દીમાં પરિભાષા કરતી હતી. મેં તેના પિતાજીને પૂછ્યું તો તેમણે કહ્યું – તે પાંચ વર્ષની ઉંમરથી ગીતા બોલે છે. મેં પૂછ્યું ક્યાં શીખ્યું ? તો કહે – અમને પણ ખબર નથી. તો મેં પૂછ્યું – બીજા અભ્યાસની શું સ્થિતિ છે ? માત્ર ગીતા જ વાંચે છે કે પછી બીજું પણ ભણે છે ? તો તેમણે કહ્યું – નહિ જી. તે ગણિત એક વાર હાથમાં લઈ લે તો સાંજે તેને બધું કંઠસ્થ હોય છે. ઇતિહાસ લઈ લે તો સાંજે તેને બધું મોંઢે હોય છે. કહ્યું – અમને બધાને પણ આશ્ચર્ય છે કે, આખા પરિવારમાં કઈ રીતે તે આટલી પ્રતિભાવાળી છે ? હું ખરેખર ખૂબ જ પ્રભાવિત હતો. ક્યારેક કેટલાંક બાળકોને સેલિબ્રિટીનો શોખ હોય છે. પણ સોનમને આવું કંઈ નહોતું. ઇશ્વરે તેને કોઈ શક્તિ જરૂર આપી છે એવું લાગે છે મને. ખેર, આ બંને બાળકો સાથે મારી કાશી યાત્રામાં એક વિશેષ મુલાકાત હતી તો મને લાગ્યું તમને પણ કહું. ટીવી પર જે તમે જુઓ છો, સમાચારપત્રોમાં વાંચો છો તે સિવાય પણ ઘણાં કામો આપણે કરીએ છીએ અને ક્યારેક ક્યારેક આવાં કામોનો આનંદ પણ આવે છે. આ જ રીતે આ બંને બાળકો સાથે મારી વાતચીત મારા માટે યાદગાર હતી.\nમેં જોયું છે કે ‘મનની વાત’માં કેટલાક લોકો મારા માટે ઘણું કામ લઈને આવે છે. જુઓ હરિયાણાના સંદીપ શું કહે છે.\n‘સંદીપ. હરિયાણા. સાહેબ હું ઇચ્છું છું કે આપ જે ‘મનની વાત’ મહિનામાં એક વાર કરો છો તેને દર સપ્તાહે કરવી જોઈએ, કેમ કે તમારી વાતથી ઘણી પ્રેરણા મળે છે.’\nસંદીપજી, તમે શું શું કરાવશો મારી પાસે ! મહિનામાં એકવાર કરવા માટે પણ મારે એટલી ભાંજગડ કરવી પડે છે, સમયને એટલો બધો એજડસ્ટ કરવો પડે છે. ક્યારેક ક્યારેક તો અમારા આકાશવાણીના મારા સાથીઓને અડધો-પોણો કલાક રાહ જોઈને બેસી રહેવું પડે છે. પરંતુ હું તમારી ભાવનાનો આદર કરું છું. તમારા સુચન માટે હું તમારો આભારી છું. અત્યારે તો એક મહિને જ બરાબર છે.\n‘મન કી બાત’ ને એક વર્ષ પૂરું થયું છે. તમે જાણો છો ? સુભાષ બાબુ રેડિયોનો કેટલો ઉપયોગ કરતા હતા ? જર્મનીથી તેમણે પોતાનો રેડિયો શરૂ કર્યો હતો અને ભારતના નાગરિકોને સ્વતંત્રતાના આંદોલનના સંબંધમાં તેઓ સતત રેડિયોના માધ્યમ દ્વારા માહિતગાર કરતા હતા. આઝાદ હિન્દ રેડિયોની શરૂઆત એક સાપ્તાહિક ન્યૂઝ બુલેટિનથી તેમણે કરી હતી. અંગ્રેજી, હિન્દી, બંગાળી, મરાઠી, પંજાબી, પુશ્તો, ઉર્દૂ બધી ભાષાઓમાં આ રેડિયો તેઓ ચલાવતા હતા.\nમને પણ આકાશવાણી પર ‘મનની વાત’ કરતા કરતા હવે એક વર્ષ થઈ ગયું છે. મારા મનની વાત તમારા કારણે સાચા અર્થમાં તમારા મનની વાત બની ગઈ છે. તમારી વાતો સાંભળું છું, તમારા માટે વિચારું છું. તમારાં સૂચનો જોઉં છું. તેનાથી મારા વિચારોની એક દોટ શરૂ થઈ જાય છે. જે આકાશવાણીના માધ્યમથી તમારી પાસે પહોંચે છે. બોલું છું હું પણ વાત તમારી થાય છે અને આ જ તો મારો સંતોષ છે. આગામી મહિને ‘મનની વાત’ માટે ફરીથી મળીશું. તમે સૂચનો મોકલતા રહેજો. તમારા સૂચનોથી સરકારને પણ લાભ થાય છે. સુધારાની શરૂઆત થાય છે. તમારું યોગદાન મારા માટે બહુમૂલ્ય છે… અણમોલ છે…\nફરી એક વાર તમને બધાને ખૂબ ખૂબ શુભકામનાઓ… ધન્યવાદ…\nPIB AHMEDABAD.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

പറയാം. കഴിഞ്ഞ വര്ഷം ഒക്ടോബര് 3-നാണ് ആദ്യമായി എനിക്ക് ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ അവതരിപ്പിക്കുവാനുള്ള ഭാഗ്യം കൈവന്നത്. മന് കി ബാത്തിലൂടെ ഒരു വര്ഷം…… അനേകം അനേകം വിഷയങ്ങള്…… നിങ്ങള് അതില്നിന്ന് എന്തു നേടി എന്ന് എനിക്ക് അറിയില്ല. എന്നാല്, ഞാന് വളരെയധികം നേടിയെന്ന് തീര്ച്ചയായും പറയാന് കഴിയും.\nജനാധിപത്യത്തില് ജനങ്ങളുടെ അഭിപ്രായങ്ങള്ക്ക് പരമപ്രാധാന്യമാണുള്ളത്. ഇതാണ് എന്റെ ജീവിതത്തിലെ അടിസ്ഥാനപരമായ വിശ്വാസം. അതുകൊണ്ട്, ജനശക്തിയില് എനിക്ക് അപാരമായ വിശ്വാസമാണുള്ളത്. എന്നാല്, ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ എന്നെ പഠിപ്പിച്ചത്, മനസ്സിലാക്കിച്ചത്, ഞാന് അറിഞ്ഞത്, ഞാന് അനുഭവിച്ചത് ഇതില്നിന്നൊക്കെ എനിക്ക് പറയാന് കഴിയും, നാം അനുമാനിക്കുന്നതില്നിന്നും എത്രയോ അധികമാണ് ജനശക്തി. നമ്മുടെ പൂര്വ്വികര് പറയുമായിരുന്നു, ‘ജനത ജനാര്ദ്ദന്’ അതായത് ഈശ്വരന്റെതന്നെ ശബ്ദമാണ് ജനതയുടെ ശബ്ദം.’മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ പരിപാടിയിലെ എന്റെ അനുഭവങ്ങളില്നിന്നും പറയാന് കഴിയും നമ്മുടെ പൂര്വ്വികരുടെ ഈ ചിന്തയില് വലിയ ശക്തിയും സത്യവുമുണ്ടെന്ന്. കാരണം ഞാന് അതനുഭവിച്ചതാണ്. ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ലേക്ക് ഞാന് ജനങ്ങളില്നിന്നും നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് ആവശ്യപ്പെടുമായിരുന്നു. ഓരോ തവണയും രണ്ടോ നാലോ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് മാത്രമേ എനിക്ക് പരിഗണിക്കാന് കഴിഞ്ഞിരുന്നുള്ളൂ. എന്നാല്, ലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് ജനങ്ങള് സജീവമായി എനിക്ക് നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് നല്കിക്കൊണ്ടേയിരുന്നു. ഈ പങ്കാളിത്തംതന്നെ ഒരു മഹാശക്തിയാണ്. മറിച്ച് പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിക്ക് സന്ദേശം അയച്ചു, mygov.in ല് കുറിപ്പെഴുതി, കത്തയച്ചു. എന്നാല് ഒരു തവണ പോലും എനിക്കൊരവസരം ലഭിച്ചില്ല. ഇങ്ങനെയൊക്കെ ചിന്തിച്ചാല് ആരും നിരാശരായിപ്പോകില്ലേ? എന്നാല് എനിക്ക് അങ്ങനെ തോന്നിയതേയില്ല. അതേ, ശരിയാണ്. ഈ ലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് കത്തുകള് എന്നെ ഒരു വലിയ പാഠവും പഠിപ്പിച്ചു. ഭരണത്തിന്റെ സൂക്ഷ്മമായ ഒട്ടനവധി നൂലാമാലകളെക്കുറിച്ച് എനിക്ക് വിവരം ലഭിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരുന്നു. ഈ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങളെ വെറും കടലാസു കഷണങ്ങളായി കാണാതെ സാധാരണക്കാരന്റെ ആശയും അഭിലാഷവുമായി കണ്ടതിന് ഞാന് ആകാശവാണിയെയും അഭിനന്ദിക്കുന്നു. ആകാശവാണി ഈ കത്തുകളെ തുടര്ന്ന് ധാരാളം പരിപാടികള് തയ്യാറാക്കി. സര്ക്കാറിന്റെ വിവിധ വകുപ്പുകളെ ക്ഷണിച്ചുവരുത്തി. സാധാരണ ജനങ്ങള് പറഞ്ഞ കാര്യങ്ങള് അവരുടെ മുന്പില് അവതരിപ്പിച്ചു. കുറേയേറെ കാര്യങ്ങള് പരിഹരിക്കുവാന് ശ്രമിച്ചു. സര്ക്കാറിലെ തന്നെ വിവിധ വകുപ്പുകള് ജനങ്ങളുടെ കത്തുകള് വിശകലനം ചെയ്ത് ഇവയില് എന്തെല്ലാം കാര്യങ്ങളാണെന്നും ഏതെല്ലാം കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് വ്യക്തികള്ക്ക് ബുദ്ധിമുട്ട് ഉണ്ടാക്കുന്നതെന്നും ഏതെല്ലാം കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് സര്ക്കാറിന്റെതന്നെ ശ്രദ്ധയില് പെടാത്തവയെന്നും കണ്ടെത്തി. ധാരാളം വിഷയങ്ങള് താഴേത്തട്ടില്നിന്നും സര്ക്കാറിന്റെ അടുത്തെത്താന് തുടങ്ങി. പിന്നെ, വിവരങ്ങള് താഴെനിന്നും മുകളിലേക്കും മാര്ഗ്ഗനിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് മുകളില്നിന്ന് താഴേക്കും വരണമെന്നുള്ളത് ഭരണത്തിന്റെ അടിസ്ഥാനതത്വമാണെന്നത് ശരിതന്നെയാണ്. ഇത്തരത്തില് ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ അറിവുകളുടെ ഈ ഉറവിടമായി തീരുമെന്ന് ആരെങ്കിലും എപ്പോഴെങ്കിലും ചിന്തിച്ചിരുന്നുവോ? എന്നാല് അത് സംഭവിച്ചു. അങ്ങിനെ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ സാമൂഹത്തിന്റെ ശക്തി പ്രകടിപ്പിക്കുവാനുള്ള ഒരവസരം ഒരുക്കി. ഞാന് ഒരു ദിവസം selfie with daughter എന്ന് പറഞ്ഞതും ലോകം മുഴുവന് ആശ്ചര്യപ്പെട്ടുപോയി. ലോകത്തിലെ എല്ലാ കോണുകളില്നിന്നും ആരെങ്കിലുമൊക്കെ selfie with daughter എടുക്കുകതന്നെ ചെയ്തു. ലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് ആളുകള് ഇങ്ങനെ പെണ്മക്കളോടൊപ്പം ഫോട്ടോയെടുത്തത് അവരുടെ ധൈര്യവും വിശ്വാസവുമാണ് വര്ദ്ധിപ്പിച്ചത്. പെണ്കുട്ടികള്ക്ക് സമൂഹത്തില് അര്ഹമായ ആദരവ് കിട്ടി. ഒപ്പംതന്നെ കുടുംബത്തില് പെണ്കുട്ടികളോടുള്ള പ്രതിബദ്ധത വര്ദ്ധിച്ചു. ഈ ചിത്രങ്ങള് കണ്ടവര്ക്കും പെണ്കുട്ടികളോടുള്ള വേര്തിരിവ് ഉപേക്ഷിക്കണമെന്ന് മനസ്സില് തോന്നി. ഇത് ഒരു നിശബ്ദ വിപ്ലവമായിരുന്നു.\nഇന്ത്യയുടെ ടൂറിസത്തെ ഉദ്ദേശിച്ചുകൊണ്ട് ഞാന് ഇതുപോലെ പറഞ്ഞിരുന്നു incredible India – സഹോദരന്മാരെ നിങ്ങളും യാത്ര ചെയ്യുന്നവരാണല്ലോ. നല്ല ചിത്രങ്ങള് ലഭിച്ചാല് ഞാന് നോക്കാം. ഇങ്ങനെ ചെറിയ ചെറിയ കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് പറഞ്ഞത്. എന്നാല്, പ്രതികരണങ്ങള് ആശ്ചര്യപ്പെടുത്തുന്നതായിരുന്നു. ഭാരതത്തിന്റെ ഓരോ മുക്കിലും മൂലയിലുംനിന്ന ജനങ്ങള് ലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് ചിത്രങ്ങള് അയച്ചുതന്നു. നമ്മുടെ പക്കല് ഇത്രയധികം പൈതൃകസമ്പത്തുണ്ടെന്ന് ഒരുപക്ഷേ ഭാരത സര്ക്കാരിന്റെയോ സംസ്ഥാനസര്ക്കാരിന്റെയോ ടൂറിസം വകുപ്പുകള് ചിന്തിച്ചിട്ടുകൂടിയുണ്ടാകില്ല. ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ അതിനൊരു വേദിയാകുകയും സര്ക്കാരിന് ഒരു രൂപപോലും ചിലവില്ലാതെ ജനങ്ങള് ജോലി ഏറ്റെടുത്തു മുന്നോട്ടുപോയി.\nകഴിഞ്ഞ വര്ഷം ഒക്ടോബര് ആദ്യം എന്റെ ആദ്യ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ പരിപാടിയില് ഗാന്ധിജിയെക്കുറിച്ച് പരാമര്ശിക്കാന് കഴിഞ്ഞതില് എനിക്ക് സന്തോഷം തോന്നി. ഗാന്ധിജയന്തിയെക്കുറിച്ച് പരാമര്ശിച്ചപ്പോള് ഞാന് ജനങ്ങളോട് ഒക്ടോബര് 2 മഹാത്മാഗാന്ധിയുടെ ജന്മദിനം രാഷ്ട്രം മുഴുവന് ഖാദി ഉല്പന്നങ്ങള്ക്ക് പ്രോത്സാഹനം നല്കി ആഘോഷിക്കണമെന്ന് അഭ്യര്ത്ഥിച്ചിരുന്നു. രാഷ്ട്രത്തിനുവേണ്ടി ഖാദി എന്നു പറഞ്ഞ ഒരു കാലമുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. കാലത്തിന്റെ മാറ്റത്തിനനുസരിച്ച് ഇപ്പോള് അത് ഫാഷനുവേണ്ടി ഖാദി എന്നാക്കിക്കൂടെ? ജനങ്ങളോട് ഞാന് നിങ്ങള് ഖാദി വാങ്ങണം, എന്തെങ്കിലും ചെയ്യണമെന്ന് ആഗ്രഹം പ്രകടിപ്പിച്ചിരുന്നു. അതിനുശേഷം ഖാദി വില്പന ഏകദേശം ഇരട്ടിയായി എന്ന് ഞാന് സന്തോഷത്തോടെ പറയട്ടെ. ഇത് സര്ക്കാര് പരസ്യംകൊണ്ട് സംഭവിച്ചതല്ല. ലക്ഷങ്ങളും കോടികളും ചെലവഴിച്ചുണ്ടായ നേട്ടമല്ലിത്. ജനശക്തിയുടെ ഒരനുഭവം; ഒരു വിജയമാണിത്.\nഒരു തവണ ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ല് ഞാന് പറഞ്ഞിരുന്നു, പാവപ്പെട്ടവന്റെ വീട്ടില് വിറകടുപ്പ് പുകയുന്നു, കുട്ടികള് കരയുന്നു, അമ്മമാര് കഷ്ടപ്പെടുന്നു. അവര്ക്ക് പാചകവാതകസിലിണ്ടര് ലഭിക്കേണ്ടതല്ലേ? ഞാന് സമ്പന്നരോട് നിങ്ങള്ക്ക് സബ്സിഡി ഉപേക്ഷിക്കാന് കഴിയില്ലേ എന്ന് ചോദിച്ചിരുന്നു. ഇന്ന് എനിക്ക് വളരെ സന്തോഷത്തോടെ പറയുവാന് കഴിയും, നമ്മുടെ രാജ്യത്തെ മുപ്പത് ലക്ഷം കുടുംബങ്ങള് പാചകവാതകത്തിന്റെ സബ്സിഡി ഉപേക്ഷിച്ചിരിക്കുന്നു. ഇവരാരും അതിസമ്പന്നരല്ല. ഒരു ടി.വി. ചാനലില് ഒരു റിട്ടയേര്ഡ് സ്ക്കൂള് ടീച്ചര്, വിധവയായ സ്ത്രീ സബ്സിഡി വേണ്ടെന്നുവയ്ക്കുവാന് ക്യൂവില് നില്ക്കുന്നതായി ഞാന് കണ്ടു. ഇടത്തരക്കാര്, താഴ്ന്നതട്ടിലുള്ളവര് ഇവര്ക്കൊക്കെ സബ്സിഡി ഉപേക്ഷിക്കുവാന് ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടാണ്. എന്നാല് ഇങ്ങനെയുള്ളവര് സബ്സിഡി ഉപേക്ഷിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇത് നിശബ്ദവിപ്ലവമല്ലേ? ഇതില് നമുക്ക് ജനശക്തി ദര്ശിക്കാന് കഴിയില്ലേ.\nനമ്മുടെ സര്ക്കാര് ചട്ടക്കൂട്ടിനുള്ളില് എന്തെല്ലാം കാര്യങ്ങള് നടക്കുന്നുണ്ടോ ഈ ചട്ടക്കൂടിനു പുറത്ത് ഒരു വലിയ ജനശക്തി – കഴിവുറ്റതും ഊര്ജ്ജസ്വലവും ദൃഢനിശ്ചയത്തോടുകൂടിയതുമായ ഒരു സമൂഹം ഉണ്ടെന്ന പാഠം സര്ക്കാരുകള് ഉള്ക്കൊള്ളേണ്ടതായുണ്ട്. സര്ക്കാരുകള് എത്രമാത്രം സമൂഹത്തോട് ചേര്ന്ന് നിന്നു പ്രവര്ത്തിക്കുന്നുവോ അത്രയുമധികം സാമൂഹിക പരിവര്ത്തനത്തിനുള്ള ഒരു നല്ല ഉല്പ്രേരകമെന്ന നിലയില് പ്രവര്ത്തിക്കാന് കഴിയും. ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ല് എനിക്ക് ഏതെല്ലാം കാര്യങ്ങളിലായിരുന്നുവോ പ്രതീക്ഷ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നത് ഇന്ന് അതെല്ലാം വിശ്വാസമായി മാറിക്കഴിഞ്ഞു, ആദരവായി മാറിക്കഴിഞ്ഞു. അതുകൊണ്ടുതന്നെ ഞാന് ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ എന്ന പരിപാടിയിലൂടെ ജനശക്തിയെ ഇതാ നൂറുവട്ടം നമസ്ക്കരിക്കുന്നു. ഞാന് ഓരോ ചെറിയ കാര്യത്തെയും സ്വായത്തമാക്കി നാടിന്റെ നന്മയ്ക്കായുള്ള പ്രവര്ത്തനങ്ങളില് പങ്കാളിയായി. ഇതില്പ്പരം സന്തോഷിക്കാന് മറ്റെന്തുണ്ട്?\n‘മന് കി ബാത്തില്’ ഇത്തവണ ഒരു പുതിയ പരീക്ഷണം നടത്തുന്നതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ഞാന് ആലോചിച്ചു. രാജ്യത്തെ ജനങ്ങളോട് നിങ്ങള് ടെലഫോണ് ചെയ്ത് ചോദ്യങ്ങള്, നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് എന്നിവ രേഖപ്പെടുത്തിയാല് ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ല് ഉള്പ്പെടുത്താമെന്ന് ഞാന് അറിയിച്ചു. ഞാന് സന്തോഷത്തോടെ പറയട്ടെ, ഏകദേശം അമ്പത്തയ്യായിരത്തിലധികം സന്ദേശങ്ങള് ഇങ്ങനെ ലഭിച്ചു. സിയാച്ചില് നിന്നായാലും ശരി, കച്ചില് നിന്നായാലാം ശരി കാംരൂപില് നിന്നായിക്കൊള്ളട്ടെ, കാഷ്മീരില് നിന്നോ കന്യാകുമാരിയില് നിന്നോ ആയിക്കൊള്ളട്ടെ. ജനങ്ങള് ഫോണ്കോളുകള് ചെയ്യാത്ത ഒരു പ്രദേശവും ഇന്ത്യയില് ഉണ്ടാവില്ല. ഇതുതന്നെ സുഖപ്രദമായ ഒരനുഭവമാണ്. എല്ലാ പ്രായത്തിലുള്ള ആളുകളും സന്ദേശം അയച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ചില സന്ദേശങ്ങള് ഞാന് സ്വയം കേള്ക്കാന് ആഗ്രഹിച്ചു. അത് എനിക്ക് ഇഷ്ടപ്പെടുകയും ചെയ്തു. ബാക്കിയുള്ളവയുടെ കാര്യത്തില് എന്റെ ടീം നടപടികള് എടുത്തുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. നിങ്ങള് ഒന്നോ രണ്ടോ മിനിട്ടുമാത്രമായിരിക്കും ഇതിനുവേണ്ടി ചെലവഴിച്ചത്. എന്നാല് എന്നെ സംബന്ധിച്ച് നിങ്ങളുടെ ഫോണ്കോള്, നിങ്ങളുടെ സന്ദേശം വളരെ പ്രാധാന്യമേറിയതാണ്. സര്ക്കാരിന്റെ മുഴുവന് വകുപ്പുകളും തീര്ച്ചയായും നിങ്ങളുടെ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് പരിഗണിക്കും.\nഎന്നാല്, ഒരു കാര്യം എന്നെ ആശ്ചര്യപ്പെടുത്തുകയും ആനന്ദിപ്പിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തു. ചിലപ്പോള് തോന്നാം നമുക്കുചുറ്റും നിഷേധാത്മകത്വമാണെന്ന്. പക്ഷേ, എന്റെ അനുഭവം മറിച്ചാണ്. ഈ അമ്പത്തിയയ്യായിരംപേര് അവരവരുടെ രീതിയിലാണ് അവരുടെ കാര്യങ്ങള് പറഞ്ഞത്. ഒരു തടസ്സവുമില്ലായിരുന്നു. എന്തും പറയാമായിരുന്നു. എന്നാല് എനിക്ക് അത്ഭുതം തോന്നുന്നു. എല്ലാ കാര്യങ്ങളും ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ന്റെ ആശയങ്ങളെന്നപോലെ പൂര്ണ്ണമായും ഊര്ജ്ജദായകവും സൃഷ്ടിപരവുമായ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങളായിരുന്നു. രാജ്യത്തെ സാധാരണജനങ്ങള് കൂടി എത്രമാത്രം സൃഷ്ടിപരമായാണ് ചിന്തിക്കുന്നതെന്ന് ഇതിലൂടെ മനസ്സിലാക്കാം. ഇത് നാടിനെ സംബന്ധിച്ചിടത്തോളം എത്ര വലിയ സമ്പത്താണ്? ഒരുപക്ഷേ, ഒന്നോ രണ്ടോ ഫോണ്കോളുകള് മാത്രം കാണും ഗൗരവമേറിയ പരാതികളുടെ പശ്ചാത്തലത്തില്നിന്ന്. 90 ശതമാനത്തിലധികവും ഒരുതരത്തിലുള്ള ഊര്ജ്ജം പകര്ന്നുതരുന്ന സന്തോഷം നല്കുന്ന കാര്യങ്ങളായിരുന്നു.\nഎന്റെ ശ്രദ്ധയില്പ്പെട്ട മറ്റൊരുകാര്യം വിശേഷിച്ച് ഭിന്നശേഷിയുള്ളവര്, അതില്ത്തന്നെ കാഴ്ചയുടെ പരിമിതിയുള്ളവര്, അവരുടെ ബന്ധുജനങ്ങള് ഇവരുടെയെല്ലാം വളരെയധികം ഫോണ് വന്നിരുന്നു. അവര് തീര്ച്ചയായും റേഡിയോ കേള്ക്കുന്നുണ്ടാവും. അവരെ സംബന്ധിച്ചിടത്തോളം റേഡിയോ എത്ര പ്രാധാന്യം അര്ഹിക്കുന്നുവെന്ന് എനിക്ക് ഇതില്നിന്ന് ബോധ്യമായി. ഞാന് ഇതിന്റെ ഒരു പുതിയ വശം കാണുന്നു. ഇവര് വളരെ നല്ല കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് പറഞ്ഞത്. ഇത് സര്ക്കാരിന്റെ കാര്യക്ഷമത വര്ദ്ധിപ്പിക്കുന്നതിന് പര്യാപ്തമാണ്.\nഎനിക്ക് രാജസ്ഥാനിലെ അല്വാറില്നിന്ന് പവന് ആചാര്യ ഒരു സന്ദേശം അയച്ചുതന്നു. ഞാന് കരുതുന്നു, പവന് ആചാര്യ പറഞ്ഞ കാര്യങ്ങള് രാജ്യം മുഴുവന് കേള്ക്കേണ്ടതാണെന്ന്. നോക്കൂ, അദ്ദേഹം എന്താണ് പറയാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നുവെന്ന് തീര്ച്ചയായും കേള്ക്കൂ. ”എന്റെ പേര് പവന് ആചാര്യ. ഞാന് രാജസ്ഥാനിലെ അല്വാര് സ്വദേശിയാണ്. പ്രധാനമന്ത്രി ശ്രീ. നരേന്ദ്രമോദി അവര്കള്ക്കുള്ള എന്റെ സന്ദേശം ഇതാണ്, അങ്ങ് ദയവായി ഇത്തവണത്തെ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ പരിപാടിയിലൂടെ ഭാരതത്തിലെ ജനങ്ങളോട് ദീപാവലിക്ക് പരമാവധി മണ്ചെരാതുകള് ഉപയോഗിക്കാന് അഭ്യര്ത്ഥിക്കണം. ഇത് പരിസ്ഥിതിക്ക് ഗുണകരമാകുന്നതിനോടൊപ്പം ആയിരക്കണക്കിന് മണ്പാത്രനിര്മ്മാണ സഹോദരങ്ങള്ക്ക് തൊഴില് ലഭിക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള അവസരം ഉണ്ടാക്കുകയും ചെയ്യും. നന്ദി.” പവന് ആചാര്യയെപ്പോലെ താങ്കളുടെ ഈ വികാരം ഭാരതത്തിന്റെ മുക്കിലും മൂലയിലും എത്തിച്ചേരുകയും പ്രചരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുമെന്ന് ഞാന് വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു. നല്ല നിര്ദ്ദേശമാണ് നല്കിയിരിക്കുന്നത്. മണ്ണിനാണെങ്കില് വിലയുമില്ല. അതുകൊണ്ടുതന്നെ മണ്വിളക്കുകളും അമൂല്യമാണ്. പാരിസ്ഥിതിക കാഴ്ചപ്പാടിലും അതിന് ഒരു പ്രത്യേക പ്രാധാന്യമുണ്ട്. ഈ വിളക്കുകള് ഉണ്ടാക്കുന്നത് പാവപ്പെട്ടവന്റെ വീട്ടിലാണ്. സാധുക്കള് ഈ ജോലി ചെയ്ത് നിത്യവൃത്തികഴിക്കുന്നു. ഞാന് ദേശവാസികളോടായി പറയുന്നു, വരാനിരിക്കുന്ന ഉത്സവവേളകളില് പവന് ആചാര്യ പറഞ്ഞ കാര്യങ്ങള് നാം നടപ്പിലാക്കുകയാണെങ്കില് അതിന്റെ പൊരുള് ദീപം തങ്ങളുടെ വീടുകളില് തെളിയും എന്നാല് പ്രകാശം പരക്കുന്നത് പാവപ്പെട്ടവന്റെ വീടുകളിലുമായിരിക്കും.\nഎന്റെ പ്രിയപ്പെട്ട ദേശവാസികളെ, ഗണേശചതുര്ത്ഥിദിവസം എനിക്ക് സൈന്യത്തിലെ ജവാന്മാരോടൊപ്പം രണ്ടുമൂന്നു മണിക്കൂറുകള് ചെലവഴിക്കുന്നതിനുള്ള അവസരം ലഭിച്ചു; കടല്-കര-വ്യോമ സംരക്ഷണം നടത്തുന്ന നമ്മുടെ സേനയോടൊപ്പം. 1965-ല് പാക്കിസ്ഥാനുമായി നടന്ന യുദ്ധത്തിന് 50 വര്ഷം പൂര്ത്തിയായി. ഇതിന്റെപേരില് ദില്ലിയിലെ ഇന്ത്യാഗേറ്റില് ഒരു ‘ശൗര്യാഞ്ജലി’ പ്രദര്ശനം സംഘടിപ്പിക്കപ്പെട്ടു. ഞാന് അത് വളരെ താത്പര്യപൂര്വ്വം നോക്കിക്കണ്ടു. അവിടെ പോയത് അര മണിക്കൂര് നേരത്തേയ്ക്ക്. പക്ഷേ, മടങ്ങിയപ്പോള് രണ്ടര മണിക്കൂര് കടന്നുപോയതറിഞ്ഞില്ല. എന്നിട്ടും, ചിലതെല്ലാം വിട്ടുംപോയി. അവിടെ എന്താണ് ഇല്ലായിരുന്നത്? ചരിത്രം മുഴുവനും ജീവനോടെ വന്നിരിക്കുന്നു. സൗന്ദര്യാത്മകമായ കാഴ്ചപ്പാടിലൂടെ നോക്കിയാലും ശ്രേഷ്ഠതരമാണ്. ചരിത്രപരമായ വീക്ഷണത്തിലൂടെയായാലും വിജ്ഞാനപ്രദമാണ്. ജീവിതത്തിന് പ്രചോദനം നല്കുന്നതിലും മാതൃഭൂമിക്കുവേണ്ടി സേവനം അനുഷ്ഠിക്കുന്ന കാര്യത്തിലും ഇതില്പ്പരം പ്രേരണയേകുന്ന മറ്റൊന്നില്ല. യുദ്ധത്തിന്റെ അഭിമാനമുഹൂര്ത്തങ്ങളില് നമ്മുടെ സൈനികര് കാഴ്ചവച്ച അദമ്യമായ സാഹസത്തിന്റെയും ആത്മാര്പ്പണത്തിന്റെയും ത്യാഗത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് നാം കേട്ടിരുന്നു. അന്ന് ഇത്രയും ചിത്രങ്ങളും ലഭ്യമായിരുന്നില്ല. ഇത്രയും വീഡിയോഗ്രഫിയും ഉണ്ടയിരുന്നില്ല. ഈ പ്രദര്ശനത്തില്നിന്നും ഒരനൂഭൂതിതന്നെയുണ്ടായി.\nയുദ്ധം ഹാജീപീറിലേതായാലും അസല്ഉത്തറിലേതായാലും ചാമിന്ദായിലേതായാലും ഹാജീപീര് പാസിലെ വിജയത്തിന്റെ ദൃശ്യങ്ങള് കണ്ടാല് രോമാഞ്ചമുണ്ടാവും. നമ്മുടെ സൈന്യത്തിലെ ജവാന്മാരെക്കുറിച്ച് അഭിമാനം തോന്നുന്നു. ആ ധീരന്മാരുടെ വീട്ടുകാരെ കാണാന് കഴിഞ്ഞു. രാജ്യത്തിന് സ്വയം സമര്പ്പിച്ച ആ കുടുംബങ്ങളെ കാണാന് കഴിഞ്ഞു. യുദ്ധത്തിന്റെ ഭാഗമാകാന് കഴിഞ്ഞ അവരൊക്കെ ജീവിതത്തിന്റെ സായാഹ്നഘട്ടത്തിലാണ്. അവരും വന്നിരുന്നു. അവര്ക്ക് ഹസ്തദാനം നല്കുമ്പോള് തോന്നുന്നുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ഹായ്, എന്ത് ഊര്ജ്ജമാണ്. ഒരു പ്രചോദനം തരുന്നതുപോലെ. നിങ്ങള് ചരിത്രം ഉണ്ടാക്കാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നുവെങ്കില് ചരിത്രത്തിന്റെ സൂക്ഷ്മതലങ്ങളെ അറിയുകയും മനസ്സിലാക്കുകയും ചെയ്യേണ്ടത് അനിവാര്യമാണ്. ചരിത്രം നമ്മെ നമ്മുടെ വേരുകളോട് ചേര്ക്കുന്നു. ചരിത്രവുമായി ബന്ധം നഷ്ടപ്പെടുകയാണെങ്കില് ചരിത്രനിര്മ്മാണത്തിന്റെ സാധ്യതകള്ക്കും പൂര്ണ്ണവിരാമം സംഭവിക്കുന്നു. ഈ പ്രദര്ശനത്തിലൂടെ ചരിത്രത്തിന്റെ അനുഭൂതിയാണ് ഉണ്ടാകുന്നത്. ചരിത്രത്തെക്കുറിച്ചുള്ള അറിവുണ്ടാകുന്നു. പുതിയ ചരിത്ര നിര്മ്മാണത്തിനുള്ള പ്രേരണയുടെ വിത്തുകളും വിതയ്ക്കപ്പെടുന്നു. ഞാന് നിങ്ങളേവര്ക്കും നിങ്ങളുടെ കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങള്ക്കും – നിങ്ങള് ഡല്ഹിയുടെ ചുറ്റുവട്ടത്താണെങ്കില് – ഒരുപക്ഷേ, പ്രദര്ശനം ഇനിയും കുറച്ചു ദിവസംകൂടി നീളും. തീര്ച്ചയായും നിങ്ങള് പോയി കാണുമെന്ന് ഞാന് കരുതുന്നു. എന്നെപ്പോലെ തിടുക്കം കാണിക്കരുത്. ഞാന് രണ്ടുരണ്ടര മണിക്കൂറിനകം തിരികെപ്പോയി. എന്നാല്, നിങ്ങള് മൂന്നുനാലു മണിക്കൂര് തീര്ച്ചയായും അവിടെ ചെലവഴിക്കണം. തീര്ച്ചയായും കണ്ട് ആസ്വദിക്കണം.\nജനാധിപത്യത്തിന്റെ ശക്തി കണ്ടാലും. ഒരു ചെറിയ കുട്ടി പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയോട് ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടിരിക്കുന്നു; ആജ്ഞാസ്വരത്തില്. എന്നാല് വെപ്രാളത്തിനിടയില് ആ കുട്ടി തന്റെ പേരു പറയാന് മറന്നുപോയി. അതുകൊണ്ട് എനിക്ക് അവന്റെ പേര് അറിയില്ല. എന്നാല് അവന് പറഞ്ഞ കാര്യം പ്രധാനമന്ത്രി വേണ്ടത്ര ഗൗരവത്തില് എടുക്കേണ്ടതുതന്നെയാണ്. നമ്മള് എല്ലാം, ദേശവാസികളും ഗൗരവമായി കാണേണ്ടതാണ്. ആ കുട്ടി നമ്മോടെന്താണ് പറഞ്ഞതെന്ന് കേട്ടാലും. ”പ്രധാനമന്ത്രി മോദിജി ഞാന് താങ്കളോട് പറയാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നത്; താങ്കള് നടപ്പിലാക്കിയ സ്വച്ഛതാ അഭിയാനുവേണ്ടി താങ്കള് എല്ലാ സ്ഥലത്തും ഓരോ തെരുവിലും ചവറ്റുകുട്ട ഏര്പ്പെടുത്തിയാലും. ആ കുട്ടി ശരിയാണ് പറഞ്ഞത്. നമുക്ക് ശുചിത്വമെന്നത് ഒരു സ്വഭാവം തന്നെയായിരിക്കണം. ശുചിത്വത്തിനുവേണ്ടി നിയമങ്ങളും വേണം, എനിക്ക് ആ കുട്ടിയുടെ സന്ദേശത്തില് വളരെ സന്തോഷം തോന്നി. കാരണം, ഒക്ടോബര് 2-ന് ശുചിത്വ ഭാരതത്തിനുവേണ്ടി ഒരു മുന്നേറ്റം സംഘടിപ്പിക്കുവാനായി ഞാന് പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ചിരുന്നു. ഒരുപക്ഷേ, സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തിനുശേഷം ആദ്യമായിട്ടായിരിക്കും പാര്ലമെന്റില് മണിക്കൂറുകളോളം ശുചിത്വത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് ഇത്രയും ചര്ച്ചകള് നടന്നിട്ടുണ്ടാവുകയെന്ന് എനിക്ക് പറയാന് കഴിയും. ശുചിത്വത്തെ സംബന്ധിച്ച് പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയും സര്ക്കാരും വലിയ വലിയ കാര്യങ്ങള് പറയുന്നുണ്ട്. എന്നിട്ട് എന്ത് സംഭവിച്ചു എന്നിങ്ങനെ വിമര്ശനങ്ങള് എനിക്കും കേള്ക്കാന് കഴിഞ്ഞിട്ടുണ്ട്. അതൊന്നും ഒരു മോശമായി എനിക്ക് തോന്നിയിട്ടില്ല. ഞാന് അതില് കാണുന്ന നന്മ പാര്ലമെന്റില്പോലും ഭാരതത്തിന്റെ ശുചിത്വത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് ചര്ച്ചകള് നടക്കുന്നുവെന്നതാണ്.\nമറ്റൊന്ന്, ഒരു വശത്ത് പാര്ലമെന്റ്, മറുവശത്ത് ഈ രാജ്യത്തെ ഒരു ബാലന്, ഇരുകൂട്ടരും ശുചിത്വത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് സംസാരിക്കുന്നു. ഇതിലും വലിയ ഒരു സൗഭാഗ്യം ഒരു രാജ്യത്തിന് മറ്റെന്താണ് ഉള്ളത്? ആശയങ്ങളുടെ ഈ വിപ്ലവം വൃത്തികേടുകളോടുള്ള വെറുപ്പിന്റെ അന്തരീക്ഷം സൃഷ്ടിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. ശുചിത്വത്തെക്കുറിച്ച് ജാഗ്രത ഉണ്ടായിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇത് സര്ക്കാരുകളെ ജോലി ചെയ്യുന്നതിന് നിര്ബന്ധിതരാക്കും. പ്രാദേശികഭരണകൂടങ്ങളെ, അത് ഗ്രാമപഞ്ചായത്താകാം, ജില്ലാ പഞ്ചായത്താകാം, മുനിസിപ്പാലിറ്റിയാകാം, കോര്പ്പറേഷനാകാം, സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളാകാം, അല്ലെങ്കില് രാജ്യം തന്നെയാകാം. ഓരോ വ്യക്തിയും ഇതിനായി പണിയെടുക്കേണ്ടിവരും. ഈയൊരു വിപ്ലവത്തെ നമുക്ക് മുന്നോട്ടു നയിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. കുറ്റങ്ങളും കുറവുകളോടുംകൂടിതന്നെ മുന്നോട്ടു കൊണ്ടുപോകേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. 2019-ല് മഹാത്മാഗാന്ധിയുടെ 150-ാം ജയന്തി ആഘോഷിക്കുമ്പോള് മഹാത്മാഗാന്ധിയുടെ സ്വപ്നസാക്ഷാത്ക്കാരത്തിനുവേണ്ടി ഈ ജോലി നമ്മള് ഭാരതീയര് ഏറ്റെടുക്കണം.\nമഹാത്മാഗാന്ധി എന്താണ് പറഞ്ഞിട്ടുള്ളതെന്ന് നിങ്ങള്ക്കറിയാമോ? ശുചിത്വവും സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യവും ഇതില് ഒന്ന് തിരഞ്ഞെടുക്കേണ്ട സന്ദര്ഭമുണ്ടായാല് ഞാന് ആദ്യം ശുചിത്വം തിരഞ്ഞെടുക്കും, പിന്നീട് സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യവും. ഗാന്ധിജി സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തേക്കാളേറെ മഹത്വം ശുചിത്വത്തിന് നല്കിയിരുന്നു. വരൂ, നമുക്ക് ഒരുമിച്ച് മഹാത്മാഗാന്ധിയുടെ വാക്കുകളെ മാനിച്ചുകൊണ്ട് അദ്ദേഹത്തിന്റെ ആഗ്രഹസാഫല്യത്തിനുവേണ്ടി ഒരുമിച്ച മുന്നേറാം.\nഡല്ഹിയില്നിന്ന് ഗുല്ഷന് അറോറ ാ്യഴീ്.ശി ല് കുറിച്ചത് ദീന് ദയാല്ജിയുടെ ജന്മശതാബ്ദിയെക്കുറിച്ച് അറിയാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നുവെന്നാണ്. എന്റെ പ്രിയപ്പെട്ട നാട്ടുകാരെ, മഹാപുരുഷന്മാരുടെ ജീവിതം എല്ലായ്പ്പോഴും നമുക്ക് പ്രചോദനം നല്കുന്നതാണ്. നമ്മുടെ ജോലി, മഹാപുരുഷന്മാര് ഏത് ചിന്താസരണിയുടെ അനുയായികളായിരുന്നു എന്നതിന്റെ വിലയിരുത്തല് നടത്തലല്ല. രാജ്യത്തിനുവേണ്ടി ജീവിക്കുകയും മരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്ന ഓരോ വ്യക്തിയും നമുക്ക് പ്രചോദനമാണ്. ഈ ദിവസങ്ങളില് ഒരുപാട് മഹാപുരുഷന്മാരെ ഓര്ക്കാനുള്ള അവസരങ്ങള് വരുന്നുണ്ട്. സെപ്റ്റംബര് 25-ന് പണ്ഡിറ്റ് ദീന് ദയാല് ഉപാധ്യായ, ഒക്ടോബര് 2-ന് മഹാത്മാഗാന്ധി, ലാല്ബഹാദൂര് ശാസ്ത്രി ഒക്ടോബര് 11-ന് ജയപ്രകാശ് നാരായണ്, ഒക്ടോബര് 31-ന് സര്ദാര് വല്ലഭായ് പട്ടേല് ഇങ്ങനെ എത്രയോ പേരുകള്. വളരെ കുറച്ചേ ഞാന് പരാമര്ശിക്കുന്നുള്ളൂ. കാരണം, ഇത് വീരപുത്രന്മാരുടെ നാടാണ്.\nനിങ്ങള് ഏത് ദിവസമെടുത്താലും ചരിത്രത്തിന്റെ കിളിവാതിലിലൂടെ ഏതെങ്കിലും ഒരു മഹാപുരുഷന്റെ പേര് വെളിച്ചത്തുവരും. വരുംനാളുകളില് എല്ലാ മഹാപുരുഷന്മാരെയും നമുക്ക് ഓര്ക്കാം, ആദരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യാം. അവരുടെ ജീവിതസന്ദേശങ്ങള് വീടുവീടാന്തരം എത്തിക്കാന് ശ്രമിക്കാം. അവരില്നിന്നും എന്തെങ്കിലുമൊക്കെ പഠിക്കാന് ശ്രമിക്കാം.\nഒക്ടോബര് 2-നെക്കുറിച്ച് പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് ഒരാഗ്രഹംകൂടി ഞാന് മുന്നോട്ട് വയ്ക്കുന്നു. ഒക്ടോബര് 2 ആദരണീയനായ ബാപ്പുവിന്റെ ജയന്തിയാണ്. കഴിഞ്ഞ വര്ഷവും ഞാന് പറഞ്ഞിരുന്നു. വിവിധതരത്തിലുള്ള ഫാഷന് വസ്ത്രങ്ങള് നിങ്ങളുടെ പക്കല് ഉണ്ടായിരിക്കാം. വിവിധ തുണിത്തരങ്ങളും ഉണ്ടായിരിക്കാം. എന്നാല് അതില് ഖാദിക്കും സ്ഥാനമുണ്ടായിരിക്കണം. ഞാന് ഒരിക്കല്ക്കൂടി പറയുന്നു. ഒക്ടോബര് 2 മുതല് ഒരു മാസം ഖാദിക്ക് റിബേറ്റുണ്ട്. അത് പ്രയോജനപ്പെടുത്തിയാലും, ഖാദിക്കൊപ്പം കൈത്തറിക്കും തുല്യ മഹത്വം നല്കിയാലും. നെയ്ത്തുകാരായ സഹോദരങ്ങള് വളരെയേറെ അദ്ധ്വാനിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്. നമ്മള് 125 കോടിവരുന്ന ദേശവാസികള് അഞ്ചോ പത്തോ അമ്പതോ രൂപ വിലമതിക്കുന്ന എന്തെങ്കിലും കൈത്തറി സാധനങ്ങളോ, ഖാദിയിനങ്ങളോ വാങ്ങുമ്പോള് മൊത്തത്തില് ആ തുക ആ ദരിദ്രരായ നെയ്ത്തുകാരുടെ വീടുകളില് എത്തിച്ചേരും. ഖാദി നിര്മ്മിക്കുന്ന പാവപ്പെട്ട വിധവയുടെ വീട്ടില് എത്തപ്പെടും. അതുകൊണ്ട് ഈ ദീപാവലിക്ക് തീര്ച്ചയായും ഖാദിക്കും നിങ്ങളില് ഓരോരുത്തരുടെ വീടുകളിലും ശരീരത്തിലും ഇടം നല്കിയാലും. നിങ്ങള് ഖാദി വസ്ത്രം ധരിക്കണമെന്ന് ഞാന് ഒരിക്കലും നിര്ബന്ധിക്കില്ല. കുറച്ച്, വളരെക്കുറച്ച് അത്രമാത്രം ആഗ്രഹമേ എനിക്കുള്ളൂ. നോക്കൂ, കഴിഞ്ഞ പ്രാവശ്യം വില്പന ഏകദേശം ഇരട്ടിയായി. എത്രയോ ദരിദ്രര്ക്ക് അതിന്റെ പ്രയോജനം കിട്ടി. ലക്ഷങ്ങളും കോടികളും മുടക്കി സര്ക്കാര് പരസ്യം ചെയ്താല്പോലും ലഭിക്കാത്തത്ര ഗുണമാണ് നിങ്ങളില് ഓരോരുത്തരുടെയും ചെറിയ ചെറിയ സഹായങ്ങളില്നിന്ന ലഭിച്ചത്. ഇതാണ് ജനശക്തി. അതുകൊണ്ട് ഒരിക്കല്ക്കൂടി ആ പ്രവര്ത്തി തുടരാന് ഞാന് നിങ്ങളോട് അഭ്യര്ത്ഥിക്കുകയാണ്.\nപ്രിയമുള്ള ദേശവാസികളെ, എനിയ്ക്ക് ഒരു കാര്യത്തില് മനസ്സ് നിറഞ്ഞ സന്തോഷമുണ്ട്. അതു ഞാന് നിങ്ങളോട് പങ്കുവെയ്ക്കുന്നു. ഞാന് മെയ് മാസത്തില് കല്ക്കട്ടയ്ക്ക് പോയപ്പോള് സുഭാഷ്ചന്ദ്രബോസിന്റെ കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങള് എന്നെ കാണാന് വന്നിരുന്നു. എല്ലാം ഏര്പ്പാട് ചെയ്തത് അദ്ദേഹത്തിന്റെ മരുമകനായിരുന്നു. ഏറെനേരം സുഭാഷ്ചന്ദ്രബോസിന്റെ കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങള്ക്കൊപ്പം കളിയുംചിരിയുമായി ചിലവഴിക്കാനുള്ള അവസരം എനിയ്ക്ക് കിട്ടി. സുഭാഷ്ബാബുവിന്റെ ആ വലിയ കുടുംബം പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയുടെ വസതി സന്ദര്ശിക്കുന്ന കാര്യത്തിലും ആ ദിവസം തീരുമാനമായി. ചന്ദ്രാബോസും അവരുടെ കുടുംബവും ആ തീരുമാനവുമായി മുന്നോട്ടുപോവുകയും ചെയ്തു. അമ്പതില് കൂടുതല് വരുന്ന സുഭാഷ്ബാബുവിന്റെ കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങള് പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയുടെ വസതിയില് വരുന്നതായി കഴിഞ്ഞ ആഴ്ച എനിയ്ക്ക ഉറപ്പു ലഭിച്ചു. നിങ്ങള്ക്ക് സങ്കല്പിക്കാന് കഴിയും, ആ നിമിഷങ്ങള് എനിയ്ക്ക് എത്രമേല് സന്തോഷകരമായിരിക്കുമെന്ന്. നേതാജിയുടെ കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങള്, ഒരുപക്ഷേ, അവരുടെ ജീവിതത്തില് ആദ്യമായിട്ടായിരിക്കും എല്ലാവര്ക്കും ഒത്തുചേര്ന്ന്, ഒരുമിച്ച് പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയുടെ വസതിയില് വരാനുള്ള ഒരവസരം കിട്ടിയിട്ടുണ്ടാവുക. എന്നാല് അതിലേറെ എന്നെ സന്തോഷിപ്പിക്കുന്നത് പ്രധാനമന്ത്രിയുടെ വസതിയില് ഇത്തരത്തിലൊരു വിരുന്നു സല്ക്കാരസൗഭാഗ്യം ഇതിനു മുന്പ് ഒരിക്കലും ഉണ്ടായിട്ടില്ല എന്നതാണ്. അത് ഒക്ടോബറില് എനിയ്ക്ക് കിട്ടാന് പോകുകയാണ്. സുഭാഷചന്ദ്രബോസിന്റെ അമ്പതിലധികം വരുന്ന കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങള് വിവിധ രാജ്യങ്ങളില് താമസിക്കുന്നവരാണ്. എല്ലാവരും എത്തുന്നുണ്ട്. എത്രയോ സന്തോഷമുള്ള ഒരു നിമിഷമായിരിക്കും എനിയ്ക്കത്. അവരെ സ്വീകരിക്കുന്നതില് എനിയ്ക്ക് വളരെ സന്തോഷമുണ്ട്. വളരെയധികം ആനന്ദവും അനുഭവിക്കുന്നു ഞാന്.\nഎനിയ്ക്ക് ഭാര്ഗ്ഗവി കാനടെയില്നിന്ന് ഒരു സന്ദേശം കിട്ടി. അവരുടെ സംസാരരീതി, ശബ്ദം അതെല്ലാം കേട്ടപ്പോള് എനിയ്ക്ക് അവര് ഒരു നേതാവാണെന്നുതോന്നി. ഒരുപക്ഷേ, നേതാവാകാന് പോകുന്നവള്, അങ്ങനെയാണ് തോന്നിയത്. ”എന്റെ പേര് ഭാര്ഗ്ഗവി കാനടേ. യുവതലമുറയെ വോട്ടേഴ്സ് രജിസ്ട്രേഷനെക്കുറിച്ച് ബോധവാന്മാരാക്കണം എന്നാണ് എനിയ്ക്ക് അങ്ങയെ അറിയിക്കാനുള്ളത്. വരും നാളുകളില് അതുകൊണ്ട് യുവതലമുറയുടെ പങ്കാളിത്തം വര്ദ്ധിക്കുകയും ഭാവിയില് സര്ക്കാര് തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പിലും ഭരണനടത്തിപ്പിലും യുവതലമുറയുടെ പങ്കാളിത്തം കൂടുതല് ഉണ്ടാവുകയും ചെയ്യും. നന്ദി.”\nവോട്ടേഴ്സ് ലിസ്റ്റില് പേരു ചേര്പ്പിക്കുന്ന കാര്യവും വോട്ട് ചെയ്യുന്നതിന്റെ സംഗതികളുമാണ് ഭാര്ഗ്ഗവി പറഞ്ഞത്. താങ്കള് പറഞ്ഞത് വളരെ ശരിയാണ്. ജനാധിപത്യത്തില് ഓരോ വോട്ടര്മാരുമാണ് രാജ്യത്തിന്റെ വിധികര്ത്താക്കള്. ഈ ഒരു ജാഗ്രത വര്ദ്ധിച്ചുവരുന്നുണ്ട്. വോട്ടു ചെയ്യുന്ന ശതമാനവും വര്ദ്ധിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. ഭാരതത്തിലെ തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പു കമ്മീഷനെ ഇക്കാര്യത്തില് പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് അഭിനന്ദിക്കാന് ഞാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. കുറച്ച് വര്ഷങ്ങള്ക്കു മുമ്പ് നമ്മള് കണ്ടിരുന്നത് നമ്മുടെ ഇലക്ഷന് കമ്മീഷന് ഒരു റഗുലേറ്റര് മാത്രമായാണ് പ്രവര്ത്തിച്ചിരുന്നത്. എന്നാല് കഴിഞ്ഞ കുറച്ചു വര്ഷങ്ങളായി അതിന് വലിയ മാറ്റം വന്നിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഇന്ന് നമ്മുടെ തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പു കമ്മീഷന് റഗുലേറ്റര് അല്ലാതായിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഒരുതരത്തില് ഫെസിലിറ്റേറ്റര് ആയി മാറിയിട്ടുണ്ട്. വോട്ടേഴ്സ് ഫ്രണ്ട്ലി ആയിട്ടുണ്ട്. അവരുടെ എല്ലാ ചിന്തകളിലും പദ്ധതികളിലും സമ്മതിദായകര് മുഖ്യബിന്ദുവായിത്തീര്ന്നിരിക്കുന്നു. ഇത് വളരെ നല്ല ഒരു മാറ്റമാണ്. എന്നാല് തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പ് കമ്മീഷന് മാത്രം പ്രവര്ത്തിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരുന്നിട്ട് കാര്യമില്ല. നമ്മള്ക്കും സ്ക്കൂളിലും കോളേജുകളിലും തെരുവുകളിലും എല്ലാംതന്നെ ജാഗ്രത പുലര്ത്തേണ്ടുന്ന അന്തരീക്ഷം നിലനിര്ത്തേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പു വരുമ്പോള്മാത്രം ജാഗരൂകരാകുന്ന അവസ്ഥ മാറണം. സമ്മതിദായകരുടെ പട്ടിക പുതുക്കിക്കൊണ്ടുതന്നെയിരിക്കണം. നമ്മളും അത് ശ്രദ്ധിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. എനിയ്ക്ക് അമൂല്യമായ ഏത് അധികാരമാണ് കിട്ടിയിട്ടുള്ളത് ആ അധികാരം സുരക്ഷിതമാണോ അല്ലയോ, നമ്മള് അധികാരം ഉപയോഗിക്കുന്നുണ്ടോ ഇല്ലയോ എന്നതല്ല മറിച്ച്, ശീലങ്ങള് നമ്മള് നിലനിര്ത്തേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. ഞാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നത് രാജ്യത്തെ ചെറുപ്പക്കാര് വോട്ടര് പട്ടികയില് പേര് ചേര്ത്തിട്ടില്ലെങ്കില് അത് ചെയ്യുകയും തങ്ങളുടെ വോട്ടവകാശം വിനിയോഗിക്കുകയും വേണം. പൊതുവായി ഞാന് പറയാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നത് തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പു ദിവസം ആദ്യം വോട്ടുചെയ്യല് പിന്നെ ജലപാനം. അത്ര പവിത്രമായ ഒരു കാര്യമാണ്. അത് എല്ലാവരും ചെയ്യുകയും വേണം.\nമിനിഞ്ഞാന്ന് ഞാന് കാശിയില് പോയിവന്നു. ഒരുപാട് ആളുകളെ കണ്ടു. വളരെയേറെ കാര്യപരിപാടികള് നടന്നു. ഇത്രയും ആളുകളെ കണ്ടതില് രണ്ടു കുട്ടികളുടെ കാര്യം മാത്രം ഞാന് നിങ്ങളുമായി പങ്കുവെയ്ക്കാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. ഒന്ന്, ഒരു ഏഴു വയസ്സുകാരന് ക്ഷിതിജ് പാണ്ഡെ\nബനാറസ് ഹിന്ദു വിശ്വവിദ്യാലയത്തിലെ കേന്ദ്രീയ വിദ്യാലയത്തില് 7-ാം ക്ലാസ്സില് പഠിക്കുന്നു. വളരെ മിടുമിടുക്കന്. അതിശയിപ്പിക്കുന്നതായിരുന്നു അവന്റെ ആത്മവിശ്വാസം. ഇത്ര ചെറുപ്രായത്തില്ത്തന്നെ ഭൗതികശാസ്ത്രത്തിലുള്ള അവന്റെ അഭിരുചി ഞാന് കണ്ടറിഞ്ഞു. ഒരുപാട് അവന് വായിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാവണം. ഇന്റര്നെറ്റ് സര്ഫിംഗ് ചെയ്തിട്ടുണ്ടാവണം. പുതിയ പുതിയ പ്രയോഗങ്ങള് പരിചയിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാവണം. തീവണ്ടിയപകടങ്ങള് എങ്ങനെ തടയാം? എന്ത് സാങ്കേതികതകൊണ്ട് ഊര്ജ്ജച്ചിലവ് കുറയ്ക്കാം? യന്ത്രമനുഷ്യരെക്കൊണ്ട് വിവരങ്ങള് എങ്ങനെ ചോര്ത്താം ഇങ്ങനെ എന്തൊക്കെ കാര്യങ്ങളാണ് അവന് സംസാരിച്ചത്. അതിശയകരമായിരിക്കുന്നു. കൊള്ളാം അവന് പറഞ്ഞ കാര്യങ്ങള് എത്രമാത്രം സൂക്ഷ്മവും സത്യവുമായിരുന്നു. പക്ഷേ, ഞാന് നോക്കിക്കാണാന് ശ്രമിച്ചത് അവന്റെ ആത്മവിശ്വാസത്തിന്റെ നിലവാരത്തെയായിരുന്നു. അവന്റെ അഭിരുചിയെയായിരുന്നു. നമ്മുടെ രാജ്യത്തെ കുട്ടികളില് ശാസ്ത്രാഭിമുഖ്യവും താല്പര്യവും വര്ദ്ധിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട് എന്ന് ഞാന് ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നു. കുട്ടികളുടെ മനസ്സില് നിരന്തരം ചോദ്യങ്ങളുണ്ടാവണം. എന്തുകൊണ്ട്? എങ്ങനെ? എപ്പോള്? ഇങ്ങനെ കുട്ടികള് സ്വയം ചോദിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കണം.\nഅതുപോലെതന്നെ സോനം പട്ടേലെന്ന വളരെ ചെറിയ ഒരു പെണ്കുട്ടിയേയും എനിയ്ക്ക് കാണാന് കഴിഞ്ഞു. 9 വയസ്സുമാത്രം പ്രായം. വാരാണസിയിലെ സുന്ദര്പൂര് എന്ന സ്ഥലത്ത് താമസിക്കുന്ന സദാവൃത പട്ടേലിന്റെ മകള്. വളരെ ദരിദ്രകുടുംബത്തിലെ അംഗം. ഞാന് ആശ്ചര്യപ്പെട്ടുപോയി. കുട്ടിയ്ക്ക് ഗീത മുഴുവന് കാണാപാഠമായിരുന്നു. എന്നാല്, അതിലേറെ വലിയ കാര്യം ഞാന് ശ്ലോകങ്ങളെക്കുറിച്ച് അവളോടു ചോദിച്ചതും ഇംഗ്ലീഷില് വ്യാഖ്യാനിച്ച് ഹിന്ദിയില് തര്ജ്ജിമ ചെയ്ത് പറഞ്ഞുതന്നു. അവളുടെ അച്ഛനോട് ചോദിച്ചപ്പോള് പറഞ്ഞു, 5 വയസ്സു മുതല് ഇതെല്ലാം പറഞ്ഞുകൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു എന്നാണ്. ഞാന് ചോദിച്ചു, എവിടുന്നു പഠിച്ചു? അവര്ക്കുതന്നെ അറിയില്ല. അപ്പോള് ഞാന് ചോദിച്ചു, ഇതല്ലാതെ മറ്റെന്തൊക്കെയാണ് പഠിച്ചതെന്ന്? ഗീത മാത്രമാണോ പറയുന്നത്, അതല്ലാതെ മറ്റെന്തെങ്കിലും ഹൃദിസ്ഥമാക്കിയിട്ടുണ്ടോ? അപ്പോള് അവര് പറഞ്ഞു, കണക്ക് ഒരു പ്രാവശ്യം കയ്യിലെടുത്താല്മതി വൈകുന്നേരമാകുമ്പോള് എല്ലാം മന:പാഠമായിരിക്കും. ചരിത്രമാണെങ്കിലും വൈകുന്നേരം എല്ലാം കാണാപാഠമാക്കും. അവര്ക്കുപോലും അതിശയമാണെന്നാണ് അവര് പറഞ്ഞത്. അവള്ക്കുള്ളില് എന്താണെന്ന് വീട്ടിലുള്ളവര്ക്ക് അറിയില്ല. സത്യത്തില് അത് എന്നെ വല്ലാതെ സ്വാധീനിച്ചു. ചിലപ്പോള് ചില കുട്ടികളില് വല്ലാതെ സെലിബ്രിറ്റിയുടെ പരിവേഷമുണ്ടാവും. അങ്ങനത്തെ ഭാവമൊന്നും സോനമിന് ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നില്ല. ഈശ്വരന് അവള്ക്ക് സ്വയം എന്തോ ശക്തി കൊടുത്തിട്ടുണ്ടാവണം എന്ന് എനിയ്ക്ക് തോന്നി.\nഎന്റെ കാശി യാത്രയിലെ വളരെ പ്രധാനപ്പെട്ട രണ്ട് കൂടിക്കാഴ്ചകളായിരുന്നു ഈ രണ്ട് കുട്ടികളുടേതും. അപ്പോള് നിങ്ങളോടും പങ്കുവെയ്ക്കണമെന്ന് എനിയ്ക്ക് തോന്നി. ടിവിയില് നിങ്ങള് കാണുന്നതും പത്രങ്ങളിലൂടെ അറിയുന്നതുമല്ലാത്ത ഒരുപാടു കാര്യങ്ങള് ഞങ്ങള് ചെയ്യുന്നുണ്ട്. ചിലപ്പോഴൊക്കെ ഒരുതരത്തിലുള്ള ആനന്ദവും അതിലൂടെ എനിയ്ക്ക് ലഭിക്കുന്നു. ഈ കുട്ടികളോടുള്ള എന്റെ ഈ സംസാരം മനസ്സില് തങ്ങിനില്ക്കാറുണ്ട്. കുറേപ്പേര് ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ലൂടെ ഒരുപാടു കാര്യങ്ങള് ചെയ്യാന് എന്നെ ഏല്പിക്കാറുമുണ്ട്. നോക്കൂ, ഹരിയാനയിലെ സന്ദീപിന് പറയാനുള്ളത് ഇതാണ്, ”സര്, മാസത്തിലൊരിക്കല് പ്രക്ഷേപണം ചെയ്യുന്ന ഈ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ ആഴ്ചതോറും പ്രക്ഷേപണം ചെയ്തുകൂടെ? എന്തെന്നാല് അങ്ങയുടെ വാക്കുകള് ഞങ്ങള്ക്ക് ഏറെ പ്രചോദനമാണ് നല്കുന്നത്.” സന്ദീപ്ജി താങ്കള് ഇനി എന്തൊക്കെയാണ് എന്നെക്കൊണ്ട് ചെയ്യാനിരിക്കുന്നത്. മാസത്തില് ഒരു തവണ ചെയ്യാന്തന്നെ എന്തു ക്ലേശമാണെന്നോ? എന്റെ സമയം അതിനൊത്ത് ക്രമീകരിക്കേണ്ടി വരുന്നു. ആകാശവാണിയിലെ സുഹൃത്തുക്കള്ക്ക് അര മുക്കാല് മണിക്കൂറോളം എന്നെയും കാത്തിരിക്കേണ്ടി വരുന്നു. പക്ഷേ, ഞാന് നിങ്ങളുടെ വികാരത്തെ മാനിക്കുന്നു. ഈ നിര്ദ്ദേശത്തോട് കടപ്പെട്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. തല്ക്കാലം ഒരു മാസത്തെ ഈ പ്രക്ഷേപണം തന്നെയാണ് നല്ലത്.\nഒരുതരത്തില് നോക്കുകയാണെങ്കില് ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ന് ഒരു വര്ഷം തികഞ്ഞിരിക്കുന്നു. നിങ്ങള്ക്കറിയാമോ, സുഭാഷ്ബാബു റേഡിയോയെ എത്രമാത്രം ജനങ്ങളുമായി സമ്പര്ക്കംപുലര്ത്താന് ആശ്രയിച്ചിരുന്നുവെന്ന്. ജര്മ്മനിയില്നിന്നാണ് തുടക്കം. സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യസമരപ്രസ്ഥാനത്തെപ്പറ്റി ഹിന്ദുസ്ഥാനിലെ പൗരന്മാരെ റേഡിയോയിലൂടെയാണ് ഉദ്ബോധിപ്പിച്ചുകൊണ്ടിരുന്നത്. ആസാദ് ഹിന്ദ് റേഡിയോയുടെ തുടക്കം പ്രതിവാര വാര്ത്താബുള്ളറ്റിനിലൂടെയായിരുന്നു. ഇംഗ്ലീഷ്, ഹിന്ദി, ബംഗാളി, മറാഠി, പഞ്ചാബി, പഷ്തോ, ഉറുദു തുടങ്ങിയ ഭാഷകളിലെല്ലാം അദ്ദേഹം പ്രക്ഷേപണം നടത്തിയിരുന്നു.\nഞാനും ആകാശവാണിയിലൂടെ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ അവതരിപ്പിച്ച് ഒരു വര്ഷം പൂര്ത്തിയാക്കിയിരിക്കുന്നു. എന്റെ ഈ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ പരിപാടി ശരിയായ അര്ത്ഥത്തില് നിങ്ങള് കാരണം നിങ്ങളുടെ ‘മന് കി ബാത്ത്’ ആയി മാറിക്കഴിഞ്ഞു. നിങ്ങള്ക്ക് പറയാനുള്ളത് കേള്ക്കുമ്പോള് ഞാന് നിങ്ങളെപ്പറ്റി ചിന്തിക്കുന്നു. നിങ്ങളുടെ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങളിലൂടെ കടന്നുപോകുമ്പോള് എന്റെ ചിന്തകള് അതിനെ പ്രദക്ഷിണം വയ്ക്കുന്നു. അതാണ് ആകാശവാണിയിലൂടെ നിങ്ങളുടെ കാതുകളിലെത്തുന്നത്. പറയുന്നത് ഞാനാണെങ്കിലും നിങ്ങളുടെ മനസ്സിലുള്ളതാണ് ഞാന് പറയുന്നത്. അതുതന്നെയാണ് എന്റെ ഏറ്റവും വലിയ സന്തോഷവും. അടുത്ത മാസം ‘മന് കി ബാത്തി’ല് നമുക്ക് കണ്ടുമുട്ടാം. നിങ്ങളുടെ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള് വന്നുകൊണ്ടേയിരിക്കട്ടെ. നിങ്ങളുടെ നിര്ദ്ദേശങ്ങള്കൊണ്ട് പ്രയോജനം സര്ക്കാരിനാണ്. അതിലൂടെ നല്ലൊരു മാറ്റത്തിന് തുടക്കമാകുന്നു. നിങ്ങളുടെ പങ്കാളിത്തം വിലപ്പെട്ടതാണ്, അമൂല്യമാണ്. ഒരിക്കല്ക്കൂടി ഒരുപാട് ശുഭാശംസകള് നേരുന്നു. നന്ദി!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari.

The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too.

It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"

        "article": "\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌ వాసులారా.. మీకు అంద‌రికీ న‌మ‌స్కారాలు. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మనసులో మాట) కార్య‌క్ర‌మంలో ఇది 12వ సంచిక. మ‌రొకలా చూస్తే ఇప్పటికి ఏడాది గ‌డచిపోయింది. గ‌త సంవత్సరం అక్టోబ‌ర్ 3న మొద‌టి సారి ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) చెప్పుకొనే సౌభాగ్యం నాకు క‌లిగింది. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) లో ఒక సంవత్సరంలో ఎన్నెన్నో మాట‌లు. దీని వ‌ల్ల మీరు ఏం పొందారో నాకైతే తెలియ‌దు; కానీ, నేనైతే ఎంతో పొందాన‌ని త‌ప్ప‌కుండా చెప్ప‌గ‌ల‌ను. ప్ర‌జాస్వామ్యంలో ప్ర‌జ‌ల శ‌క్తికి ఎంతో గొప్ప‌ద‌నం ఉంది. నా జీవితంలో ఓ ప్రాథ‌మిక ఆలోచ‌న ఉంది.. దానితో ప్ర‌జ‌ల శ‌క్తి మీద నాకు అపార‌మైన న‌మ్మ‌కం ఉంది. అయితే ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) కార్య‌క్ర‌మం ద్వారా నేను నేర్చుకున్న‌దీ, నాకు అర్థ‌మైందీ, నేను తెలుసుకున్నదీ, పొందిన‌దీ.. వీటి వ‌ల్ల నేను చెప్పేది ఏమిటంటే- మ‌నం ఆలోచిస్తాం; అంత‌కంటే ఎక్కువ‌గా జ‌న‌శ‌క్తి అపార‌మైంది అని. మ‌న పూర్వీకులు చెబుతుండే వారు ప్ర‌జ‌లు భ‌గ‌వంతుడి అంశ‌లో భాగ‌మని. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) ద్వారా నాకు అనుభ‌వ‌మైంది ఏమిటంటే, మ‌న పూర్వీకుల ఆలోచ‌న‌లలో ఒక గొప్ప శ‌క్తి ఉన్నదీ, గొప్ప నిజం ఉన్నదీ అని. ఎందుకంటే- వీటిని నేను అనుభ‌వించాను. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) కార్య‌క్ర‌మం ద్వారా నేను ప్ర‌జ‌ల నుండి స‌ల‌హాలు కోరాను. అయితే, ప్ర‌తి సారి రెండు సలహాలు, లేదా నాలుగు స‌ల‌హాలు అందేవి. కానీ, ల‌క్ష‌ల సంఖ్య‌లో ప్రజ‌లు చైత‌న్య‌వంతులై నాకు స‌ల‌హాలు పంపిస్తూ ఉండే వారు. ఇది దానంత‌ట‌దే ఒక గొప్ప శ‌క్తి; లేకుంటే, ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రికి సందేశం పంపించాం, మై గ‌వ్ డాట్ ఇన్ లో రాశాం. ఉత్త‌రాలు పంపించాం, కానీ ఒక్క‌సారి కూడా మాకు అవ‌కాశం దొర‌క‌లేదు.. అని ఎవ‌రైనా నిరాశ‌కు లోనుకావచ్చు. కానీ, నాకు అలా అనిపించ‌లేదు.\nఅవును.. ఈ ల‌క్ష‌లాది ఉత్త‌రాలు నాకొక పెద్ద పాఠాన్ని నేర్పించాయి. ప్ర‌భుత్వంలోని అనేక సున్నిత‌మైన క‌ష్టాల విష‌యంలో నాకు స‌మాచారం అందుతూ ఉండేది. నేను ఆకాశ‌వాణికి కూడా అభినంద‌న‌లు తెలియ‌జేసుకుంటున్నాను. ఎందుకంటే, శ్రోత‌ల నుండి వ‌చ్చే స‌ల‌హాల‌ను వారు కేవ‌లం కాగితం ముక్క‌లు అని అనుకోకుండా, వాటిని సామాన్య ప్ర‌జ‌ల ఆకాంక్ష‌లుగా భావించారు. దీనిని త‌ర్వాత వాళ్లు ఒక కార్య‌క్ర‌మంగా చేశారు. ప్ర‌భుత్వంలోని వివిధ విభాగాల‌ను ఆకాశ‌వాణికి ఆహ్వానించారు; ప్ర‌జ‌లు చెప్పిన విష‌యాల‌ను వారి ముందు ఉంచారు. కొన్ని విష‌యాల‌ను తోసిపుచ్చే ప్ర‌య‌త్నం చేశారు. ప్ర‌భుత్వంలోని మా వివిధ శాఖ‌లు ఈ ఉత్త‌రాల‌పై విశ్లేష‌ణ జ‌రిపాయి. వీటిలో ప్ర‌భుత్వ విధాన నిర్ణ‌యం ఏం ఉంది ? ఏ వ్య‌క్తిగ‌త కార‌ణాల వ‌ల్ల ఆందోళ‌న‌లు క‌లుగుతున్నాయి ? ప‌రద భుత్వ దృష్టిలోనే లేని ఏ అంశాలున్నాయి ? చాలా విష‌యాలు క్షేత్ర‌ స్థాయి నుండి ప్ర‌భుత్వానికి చేర‌డం మొద‌లయింది. పాల‌న‌లో ఒక మూల సూత్రం ఉంది.. అదేమిటంటే – స‌మాచారం కింది స్థాయి నుండి పై స్థాయికి చేరుతుండాలి అనేది. ఇది వాస్త‌వం. ఆదేశాలు పై నుండి కింది స్థాయికి వెళ్తుండాలి. ఈ స‌మాచార స్ర‌వంతి ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట‌)గా మారుతుంద‌ని ఎవ‌రు అనుకున్నారు ? కానీ, ఇది జ‌రిగింది. అదే విధంగా ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) స‌మాజ శ‌క్తిని తెలియ‌జేసే ఒక అవ‌స‌రంగా మార్పు చెందింది. నేను ఒక‌ రోజు అన్నాను ‘సెల్ఫీ విత్ డాట‌ర్’ అని. ప్ర‌పంచ‌మంతా ఆశ్చ‌ర్య‌పోయింది: దాదాపు ప్ర‌పంచంలోని అన్ని దేశాల నుండి ఎవ‌రో ఒక‌రు.. ల‌క్ష‌లాదిగా ‘సెల్ఫీ విత్ డాట‌ర్‌’ ను అనుసరించారు. దీనితో కుమార్తెల‌కు ఎంతో గౌర‌వం ల‌భించింది. వాళ్లు ‘సెల్ఫీ విత్ డాట‌ర్’ చేస్తున్న‌ప్పుడు అది వారి కుమార్తె ఆత్మ విశ్వాసాన్ని పెంపొందించేది; వారి లోలోప‌ల కూడా ఒక నిబద్ధతను పెంపొందిస్తూ ఉండేది; ప్ర‌జ‌లు చూసిన‌ప్పుడు ఆడ‌పిల్ల‌ల ప‌ట్ల నిర్ల‌క్ష్యం విడిచి పెట్టాల‌ని వాళ్ల‌కు కూడా అనిపిస్తుండేది. ఓ నిశ్శ‌బ్ధ విప్ల‌వం వ‌చ్చింది.. భార‌తదేశంలో ప‌ర్యాట‌క రంగాన్ని దృష్టిలో పెట్టుకుని పౌరులంద‌రికీ విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేశాను ‘ఇన్ క్రెడియ‌బుల్ ఇండియా’ సోద‌రులారా.. మీరు కూడా వివిధ ప్రదేశాలకు వెళ్తుంటారు, ఏదైనా మంచి ఫొటో ఉంటే పంపించండి నేను చూస్తాను అని. ఏదో తేలిక‌గా అనేశాను. కానీ ఎంత పెద్ద ప్రతిస్పందన. ల‌క్ష‌లాదిగా దేశం న‌లుమూల‌లా నుంచి ప్ర‌జ‌లు ఫొటోలు పంపించారు. మ‌న ద‌గ్గ‌ర ఎటువంటి వార‌స‌త్వ సంప‌ద ఉన్న‌దో – కేంద్ర ప‌ర్యాట‌క శాఖ గానీ, రాష్ట్ర ప్ర‌భుత్వాల ఆధ్వ‌ర్యంలోని ప‌ర్యాట‌క విభాగాలు గానీ ఎప్పుడూ ఆలోచించి కూడా ఉండ‌వు. ప్ర‌భుత్వ సొమ్ము ఒక్క రూపాయి కూడా ఖ‌ర్చు కాకుండానే అన్ని అంశాలు ఒకే వేదిక పైకి వ‌చ్చి చేరాయి. ప్ర‌జ‌లు ప‌నిని పెంచేశారు. గ‌త ఏడాది అక్టోబ‌ర్ నెల‌లో మొద‌టిసారి మ‌న్ కీ బాత్ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) కార్య‌క్ర‌మం సంద‌ర్భంగా నేను గాంధీ జ‌యంతిని గురించి ప్ర‌స్తావించాను, అక్టోబ‌ర్ 2న మ‌హాత్మ గాంధీ జ‌యంతిని నిర్వ‌హిస్తున్నామ‌ని విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేయ‌డానికి ఎంతో సంతోషించాను.\nఒక‌ప్పటి ఖాదీ ఫ‌ర్ నేష‌న్‌ (దేశం కోసం ఖాదీ). ప్ర‌స్తుత ప‌రిస్థితులలో దీని అవ‌స‌రం లేదా ? ఖాదీ దుస్తులు కొనుగోలు చేయండని ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌కు నేను విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేశాను. మీ వంతు స‌హ‌కారాన్ని అందించండి. గ‌త ఏడాది కాలంలో ఖాదీ విక్ర‌యాలు దాదాపు రెట్టింప‌య్యాయ‌ని తెలియ‌జేయ‌డానికి నేను ఎంతో సంతోషిస్తున్నాను. ఇది ప్ర‌భుత్వ ప్రకటనల వ‌ల్ల జ‌ర‌గ‌లేదు. కోట్లాది రూపాయ‌లు ఖ‌ర్చు పెట్ట‌డం వ‌ల్ల కాలేదు. ప్ర‌జ‌ల శ‌క్తికి ఒక నిద‌ర్శ‌నం. ఒక అనుభూతి. ఒక‌సారి నేను మ‌న్ కీ బాత్ – (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) ద్వారా చెప్పాను. పేద‌ల ఇళ్ల‌లో పొయ్యి వెలుగుతుంది, పిల్ల‌లు ఏడుస్తుంటారు… ఆ పేద త‌ల్లికి గ్యాస్ సిలిండ‌ర్ అవ‌స‌రం లేదా..? మీరు రాయితీని వ‌దులుకోలేరా.. అని ధ‌నికుల‌కు నేను విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేశాను.\nఆలోచించండి… ఈ దేశంలో 30 ల‌క్ష‌ల కుటుంబాలు గ్యాస్ సిలిండ‌ర్ పై రాయితీని వ‌దులుకున్నార‌ని తెలియ‌జేయ‌డానికి నేనెంతో సంతోషిస్తున్నాను. వాళ్లంతా ధ‌నికులు కాదు. నేనొక టీవీ ఛాన‌ల్ చూశాను, ఒక విశ్రాంత ఉపాధ్యాయుడు, వితంతు మ‌హిళ‌, త‌మ రాయితీని వ‌దులుకోవ‌డానికి బారులు తీరి నిల‌బ‌డ్డారు. స‌మాజంలోని సామాన్యులు, మ‌ధ్య‌త‌ర‌గ‌తి వ‌ర్గాలు, దిగువ మ‌ధ్య‌త‌ర‌గ‌తి వ‌ర్గాల వారు రాయితీని వ‌దులుకోవ‌డం క‌ష్ట‌మైన ప‌నే. కానీ అలాంటి వాళ్లు కూడా వ‌దులుకున్నారు. ఇదొక నిశ్శ‌బ్ద విప్ల‌వం కాదా…? ఇది ప్ర‌జ‌ల శ‌క్తికిది నిద‌ర్శ‌నం. మ‌న ప్ర‌భుత్వ కార్యాల‌యాల్లో జ‌రిగే ప‌ని… కార్యాల‌యాల వెలుప‌ల స‌మ‌ర్ధ‌మైన‌, శ‌క్తిమంత‌మైన సంక‌ల్పంతో కూడిన జ‌న‌ శ‌క్తి స‌మాజం ఉంద‌నే విష‌యం ప్ర‌భుత్వానికి బోధ‌ప‌డాల్సిన అవ‌స‌రం ఉంది. ప్ర‌భుత్వాలు ఎంత ఎక్కువ‌గా స‌మాజంతో క‌ల‌సి ప‌నిచేస్తాయో, అంత ఎక్కువ‌గా స‌మాజంలో మార్పు తీసుకురావ‌డానికి ఒక మంచి ఉత్ప్రేర‌కంగా ప‌నిచేస్తాయి. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ ద్వారా ఏ విష‌యాల్లో నాకు న‌మ్మ‌కం ఉండేదో…. ఇప్పుడు వాటిపై విశ్వాసం పెరిగింది. ఆస‌క్తి పెరిగింది; ఇందుకోసం ఈ రోజు ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్‘ కార్య‌క్ర‌మం ద్వారా ప్ర‌జ‌ల శ‌క్తికి శ‌తాధిక వంద‌నాలు తెలియ‌జేసుకుంటున్నాను. ప్ర‌తి చిన్న విష‌యాన్ని త‌మ‌దిగా చేసుకున్నారు, దేశ శ్రేయ‌స్సులో భాగ‌మ‌య్యేందుకు కృషి చేశారు. ఇంత‌కు మించిన సంతోషం ఏముంటుంది. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్‘ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) కార్య‌క్ర‌మంలో ఈసారి నేనొక కొత్త ప్ర‌యోగం చేయాల‌నుకున్నాను. ఫోన్ చేసి త‌మ ప్ర‌శ్న‌ల‌ను, త‌మ సూచ‌న‌లు, స‌ల‌హాల‌ను న‌మోదు చేయాల‌ని దేశంలోని పౌరులంద‌రికీ నేను విజ్‌‌ప్తి చేశాను, వాటిపై దృష్టి పెడ‌తాన‌ని అన్నాను. దేశం న‌లుమూల‌ల నుంచి దాదాపు 55 వేల‌కు పైగా ఫోన్ కాల్స్ నాకు వ‌చ్చాయ‌ని తెలియ‌జేయ‌డానికి సంతోషిస్తున్నాను. సియాచిన్ నుంచి కానీ, క‌చ్ ప్రాంతం నుంచి కానీ, కామరూప్‌, కాశ్మీర్ లేదా క‌న్యాకుమారి నుంచి గానీ – ఫోన్ కాల్ చేయ‌ని ప్రాంత‌మంటూ ఏదీలేదు. అన్ని ప్రాంతాల నుంచి ఫోన్లు చేశారు. ఇదొక సంతోష‌క‌ర‌మైన అనుభూతి. అన్ని వ‌య‌స్సుల వారు వారి సందేశం పంపించారు. కొన్ని సందేశాల‌ను నేను స్వ‌యంగా విన‌డానికి ఇష్ట‌ప‌డ్డాను, చాలా బాగున్నాయి. మిగ‌తా వాటిపై నా బృందం ప‌నిచేస్తోంది. మీరు ఒక‌టి రెండు నిమిషాలు స‌మ‌యం వెచ్చించి ఉంటారు. మీ ఫోన్లు, మీ సందేశాలు నాకు ఎంతో ముఖ్య‌మైన‌వి. మీ స‌ల‌హాలు, సూచ‌న‌ల‌పై మొత్తం ప్ర‌భుత్వం త‌ప్ప‌కుండా దృష్టి పెడుతుంది. అయితే నాకొక విష‌యం ఆశ్చ‌ర్యాన్ని, ఆనందాన్ని క‌ల‌గ‌జేస్తోంది – మ‌న చుట్టూ వ్యతిరేకత, ప్ర‌తికూల ప‌రిస్థితులు ఉన్నాయ‌ని అనిపిస్తూ ఉంటుంది. కానీ, నా అనుభ‌వం మ‌రోలా ఉంది. ఈ 55 వేల మంది వారికి న‌చ్చిన విధంగా త‌మ త‌మ విష‌యాల‌ను తెలియ‌జేయాల్సింది. వారికి ఏ అడ్డంకులు లేవు. ఏదైనా చెప్పే వీలుంది. కానీ నాకు ఆశ్చ‌ర్య‌మేస్తోంది. వారు చెప్పిన విష‌యాలు ఎలా ఉన్నాయంటే, వాటిపై ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్‘ ప్ర‌భావం ఉంద‌నిపిస్తోంది. వారు చెప్పిన విష‌యాలన్నీ సానుకూల దృక్ప‌థంతో ఉన్నాయి. మంచి స‌ల‌హాలుగా ఉన్నాయి. సృజ‌నాత్మ‌కంగా ఉన్నాయంటే చూడండి. దేశంలో సామాన్య పౌరులు కూడా సానుకూల ఆలోచ‌న‌ల‌తో ముందుకెళ్తున్నారు. ఇది దేశానికి ఎంత పెద్ద పెట్టుబ‌డి అవుతుందో ఆలోచించండి. తీవ్ర‌మైన ఫిర్యాదుల వంటివి ఒక శాతం లేదా రెండు శాతం ఫోన్లు ఉండ‌వ‌చ్చు. 90 శాతం కంటే ఎక్కువ మంది సంతోషాన్ని, ఆనందం క‌లిగించే విష‌యాలు తెలిపారు. నాకు మ‌రో విష‌యం గుర్తుకొచ్చింది – ప్ర‌త్యేకించి విక‌లాంగులు, అందులోనూ అంధులు మ‌న‌ వాళ్లు.. వారి వద్ద నుండి ఎన్నో ఫోన్లు వ‌చ్చాయి. అయితే ఇందుకు కార‌ణం ఏమిటంటే, వాళ్లు టీవీ చూడ‌లేరు గ‌నుక రేడియో త‌ప్ప‌క వింటుంటారు. చూపు లేని వారికి రేడియో ఎంత గొప్ప సాధ‌న‌మో, దీని ద్వారా నాకు తెలిసింది. నేను మ‌రో కొత్త కోణం చూస్తున్నాను. వాళ్లంతా ఎన్ని మంచి విష‌యాలు తెలియ‌జేశారో. ప్ర‌భుత్వాన్ని చైత‌న్యవంతం చేయ‌డానికివి చాలు. రాజ‌స్థాన్ లోని అల్ వర్ నుండి శ్రీ‌ ప‌వ‌న్ ఆచార్య ఓ సందేశాన్ని పంపించారు. శ్రీ‌ ప‌వ‌న్ ఆచార్య చెప్పిన విష‌యాలు దేశం మొత్తానికి వినిపించాల‌నుకుంటున్నాను. దేశ‌మంతా దీన్ని అంగీక‌రించాల‌ని భావిస్తున్నాను. త‌ప్ప‌కుండా వినండి ఆయ‌నేం చెప్పాల‌నుకుంటున్నాడో.\n‘నా పేరు ప‌వ‌న్ ఆచార్య‌. నేను రాజ‌స్థాన్ లోని అల్ వర్ కు చెందిన‌వాడిని. ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి శ్రీ న‌రేంద్ర‌ మోదీ కి నా విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి ఏమిటంటే, ఈసారి దీపావ‌ళికి మ‌ట్టితో చేసిన ప్ర‌మిద‌లు ఎక్కువ‌గా వాడాల‌ని మీరు ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ కార్య‌క్ర‌మం ద్వారా ద‌య‌చేసి ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌కు విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేయాల‌ని కోరుకుంటున్నాను. దీంతో ప‌ర్యావ‌ర‌ణ ప్ర‌యోజ‌నం క‌ల‌గ‌డంతో పాటు వేలాది కుమ్మ‌రుల‌కు ఉపాధి క‌లుగుతుంది. ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు’ అని.\nశ్రీ ప‌వ‌న్‌ లాగే మీ అభిప్రాయాలు కూడా దేశం న‌లుమూల‌లా చేర‌ుతాయ‌ని, వ్యాపిస్తాయ‌ని నేను భావిస్తున్నాను. మంచి స‌ల‌హా ఇచ్చారు. మ‌ట్టి కోసం ధ‌ర చెల్లించాల్సిన అవ‌స‌రం ఉండ‌దు. మ‌ట్టి ప్ర‌మిద‌లు అమూల్య‌మైన‌వి. ప‌ర్యావ‌ర‌ణ ప‌రిర‌క్ష‌ణ దృష్టితో చూసిన‌ప్పుడు వాటికి ప్రాముఖ్య‌ం ఉంది. ప్ర‌మిద‌ల‌ను పేద‌లు త‌యారుచేస్తారు. దీంతో వారికి ఉపాధి ల‌భిస్తుంది. శ్రీ ప‌వ‌న్ ఆచార్య చెప్పిన‌ట్లు రాబోయే పండుగ‌ల‌కు మ‌నం ఇళ్ల‌లో మ‌ట్టి ప్ర‌మిద‌లు వెలిగిస్తే పేద‌ల ఇళ్ల‌లో వెలుగులు నిండుతాయి.\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌వాసులారా… వినాయ‌క చ‌వితి నాడు మ‌న సైనికుల‌తో రెండు మూడు గంట‌లు గ‌డిపే అవ‌కాశం నాకు ల‌భించింది. దేశ భూభాగాన్ని, స‌ముద్రాల‌ను, ఆకాశాన్ని ప‌రిర‌క్షించేవి మ‌న సైన్యం, నావికాద‌ళం, వాయుసేన. 1965లో పాకిస్తాన్ తో యుద్ధం జ‌రిగి, 50 ఏళ్లు పూర్త‌య్యాయి. దానికి సంబంధించి న్యూ ఢిల్లీలోని ఇండియా గేట్ వ‌ద్ద శౌర్యాంజ‌లి ప్ర‌ద‌ర్శ‌నను ఏర్పాటుచేశారు. దాన్ని నేనెంతో ఆస‌క్తిగా చూశాను. అర్థ గంట కోసం వెళ్లాను. కానీ బ‌య‌ట‌కు వ‌చ్చేస‌రికి రెండున్న‌ర గంట‌లు అయిపోయాయి. మ‌రికొన్ని చూడాల్సిన‌వి ఉండిపోయాయి. చ‌రిత్ర మొత్తం స‌జీవంగా క‌నిపించింది. క‌ళా సౌంద‌ర్యం దృష్టితో చూస్తే ఉత్త‌మంగా ఉంది, చరిత్రాత్మ‌క దృష్టితో చూస్తే విజ్ఞాన‌వంతంగానూ, జీవితంలో ప్రేర‌ణ కోస‌మైతే మాతృభూమి సేవ కోసం ఇంత‌కుమించి ప్రేర‌ణ‌నిచ్చేది ఏదీ ఉండ‌దు. యుద్ధంలో మ‌న సైనికులు ప్ర‌ద‌ర్శించిన సాహ‌సోపేత ఘ‌డియ‌లు, మ‌న సైనికుల ధైర్య‌సాహ‌సాలు, వారి త్యాగాల గురించి మ‌నం వింటూ ఉండేవాళ్లం. ఆ స‌మ‌యంలో అన్ని ఫొటోలు కూడా ల‌భించేవి కావు, వీడియోగ్ర‌ఫీ కూడా అంత‌గా ఉండేది కాదు. ఈ ప్ర‌ద‌ర్శ‌న ద్వారా ఆనాటి అనుభూతి క‌లుగుతుంది. హాజీపూర్‌లో జ‌రిగిన పోరాటం కానీయండి, ఉత్త‌రాదిన జ‌రిగిన పోరాటం గానీ, చ‌మిండాలో జ‌రిగినది కానీయండీ, హాజీపూర్ పాస్ వ‌ద్ద సాధించిన విజ‌య దృశ్యాల‌ను చూస్తే రోమాలు నిక్క‌బొడుచుకుంటాయి. మ‌న సైనికుల ప‌ట్ల మ‌న‌కెంతో గ‌ర్వం క‌లుగుతుంది. ఈ వీరుల కుటుంబాల‌ను క‌లిసే అవ‌కాశం కూడా నాకు ల‌భించింది. ప్రాణాల‌ను బ‌లిదానం చేసిన వారి కుటుంబాల‌ను కూడా క‌లుసుకున్నాను. యుద్ధంలో పాల్గొన్న వారిని క‌లిశాను, వీరంతా వారి జీవితాల చ‌ర‌మ‌ ద‌శ‌లో ఉన్నారు. వారితో క‌ర‌చాల‌నం చేసిన‌ప్పుడు అనిపించింది, వాహ్‌….. ఎంత శ‌క్తి ఉంది. ఎంతో ప్రేర‌ణ‌నిస్తుంది. మ‌నం చ‌రిత్ర సృష్టించాలంటే చ‌రిత్ర గురించిన సున్నిత‌మైన విష‌యాల‌ను తెలుసుకొని, అర్థం చేసుకోవాల్సిన అవ‌స‌రం ఉంది. చ‌రిత్ర మ‌న వార‌స‌త్వంతో క‌లుపుతుంది. చ‌రిత్ర‌తో మ‌న సంబంధాలు తెగిపోతే, చ‌రిత్ర సృష్టించే అవ‌కాశాలు కూడా నిలచిపోతాయి. ఈ శౌర్య ప్ర‌ద‌ర్శ‌న ద్వారా చ‌రిత్ర అనుభూతి క‌లుగుతుంది. మ‌న‌కు చ‌రిత్ర తెలుస్తుంది, కొత్త చ‌రిత్రను సృష్టించేందుకు అవ‌స‌ర‌మైన బీజాలు మొల‌కెత్తుతాయి. నేను మిమ్మ‌ల్ని, మీ కుటుంబాల‌ను ఒకవేళ మీరు ఢిల్లీ చుట్టుప‌క్క‌ల ఉంటున్న‌ట్ల‌యితే – ఈ ప్ర‌ద‌ర్శ‌న మ‌రికొన్ని రోజులు ఉంటుంద‌నుకుంటున్నాను – మీరు త‌ప్ప‌కుండా చూడండి. నాలాగా త్వ‌ర‌త్వ‌ర‌గా చూసి వెళ్లిపోవ‌ద్దు. నేను రెండున్న‌ర గంట‌ల్లోనే తిరిగి వెళ్లిపోయాను. కానీ మీకు మూడు, నాలుగు గంట‌లు ప‌డుతుంది; త‌ప్ప‌కుండా చూడండి.\nప్ర‌జాస్వామ్య బ‌ల‌మేంటో చూడండి. ఒక చిన్న బాలుడు ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రిని ఆదేశించాడు. కానీ ఆ బాలుడు తొంద‌ర‌పాటుతో త‌న పేరు చెప్ప‌డం మ‌రచిపోయాడు. అత‌ని పేరేంటో నాకు తెలియ‌దు. కానీ అత‌ని మాట‌లు ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి దృష్టిని ఆక‌ర్షించేవిగా ఉన్నాయి, కానీ దేశ‌వాసులంద‌రు దీనిపై దృష్టి పెట్టాల్సిన అవ‌స‌రం ఉంది. వినండి ఈ బాలుడు మ‌న‌కేం చెబుతున్నాడో….\n“ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి మోదీ గారు…. మీరు అమ‌లు చేస్తున్న స్వ‌చ్ఛ‌త కార్య‌క్ర‌మం కింద అన్నిచోట్లా, అన్ని వీధుల్లో కుప్ప తొట్టి ఏర్పాటుచేయండి” అని.\nఈ బాలుడు చెప్పింది నిజ‌మే. మ‌నం ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త‌ను మ‌న స్వ‌భావంగా మార్చుకోవాల్సిన అవ‌స‌రం ఉంది. ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త‌కు అవ‌స‌ర‌మైన మౌలిక స‌దుపాయాలను ఏర్పాటుచేయాల్సిన అవ‌స‌రం ఉంది. ఈ బాలుడి సందేశంతో నాకొక గొప్ప సంతోషం క‌లిగింది. సంతోషం ఎందుకంటే – అక్టోబ‌ర్ 2న స్వ‌చ్ఛ భార‌త్ అభియాన్ ప్ర‌వేశ‌పెడుతూ ప్ర‌క‌ట‌న చేశాం. స్వాతంత్య్రం వ‌చ్చిన త‌ర్వాత మొద‌టిసారి పార్ల‌మెంట్‌లో ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త అంశంపై గంట‌ల కొద్దీ చ‌ర్చ జ‌రుగుతోంది. మా ప్ర‌భుత్వం మీద విమ‌ర్శ‌లు కూడా వ‌స్తాయి. నాకు కూడా వినాల్సి వ‌స్తూ ఉంటుంది. మోదీ గారు పెద్ద పెద్ద మాట‌లు చెబుతారు స్వ‌చ్ఛ‌త గురించి, కానీ ఏం జ‌రిగింది అని. నేను దాన్ని త‌ప్పుగా అనుకోను; నేను దీంట్లో మంచిని చూస్తున్నాను. అది దేశ పార్ల‌మెంట్ కూడా ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త గురించి చ‌ర్చించ‌డం. ఇంకోవైపు చూడండి. ఒక‌వైపు పార్ల‌మెంటేరియ‌న్లు, మ‌రోవైపు దేశంలోని ప‌సివాళ్లు… ఇద్ద‌రూ ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త గురించి మాట్లాడుతున్నారు. ఇంత‌కుమించి దేశానికి సౌభాగ్యం ఇంకేముంటుంది. అభిప్రాయాల ఉద్య‌మం ఏదైతే న‌డుస్తోందో దానివ‌ల్ల మురికి, మాలిన్యాల‌ను ద్వేషించే ప‌రిస్థితి ఏర్ప‌డుతోంది. ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త దిశ‌గా ఒక చైత‌న్యం వ‌చ్చింది. ఇది ప్ర‌భుత్వాలు కూడా ప‌నిచేయ‌క త‌ప్ప‌ని స్థితిని క‌లిగిస్తుంది. స్థానిక స్వ‌ప‌రిపాల‌న సంస్థ‌లు కూడా అవి పంచాయ‌తీలైనా, న‌గ‌ర పంచాయ‌తీలైనా, న‌గ‌ర‌పాలిక‌లైనా, మ‌హాన‌గ‌ర సంస్థ‌లైనా, ఇంకా రాష్ట్రాలైనా, కేంద్ర‌మైనా…. ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రికీ దీనిపై ప‌ని చేయాల్సి వ‌స్తుంది. ఈ ఉద్య‌మాన్ని మ‌నం ముందుకు తీసుకువెళ్లాలి. లోపాలున్నా ముందుకే తీసుకెళ్లాలి. ఇంకా 2019 సంవ‌త్స‌రంలో గాంధీ గారు 150వ జ‌యంతి జ‌రుపుకునే నాటికి ఆయ‌న స్వ‌ప్నాల‌ను సాకారం చేసే దిశ‌గా మ‌నం ప‌నిచేయాలి. ఇంకా మ‌హాత్మ గాంధీ ఏం చెప్పేవారో మీకు తెలుసు. ఒక‌సారి ఆయ‌న ఏమ‌న్నారంటే – స్వాతంత్య్రం, ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త రెండింటిలో ఒక‌టి ఎంచుకోవాల్సి వ‌స్తే తాను ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త‌నే ఎంచుకుంటాన‌నీ, స్వాతంత్య్రం ఆ త‌ర్వాతేన‌ని చెప్పారు. గాంధీ జీ కి స్వాతంత్య్రం కంటే ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌తే ముఖ్య‌మైంది. రండి… మ‌న‌మంతా క‌లసి మ‌హాత్మ గాంధీ చెప్పిన మాట‌ని అనుస‌రిద్దాం. ఆయ‌న కోరిక‌ను నెర‌వేర్చ‌డానికి మ‌న‌మూ కొన్ని అడుగులు వేద్దాం. ఢిల్లీ నుంచి శ్రీ‌ గుల్ష‌న్ అరోడా గారు మై గ‌వ్ మీద ఒక సందేశాన్ని పంపారు. దీన్ ద‌యాళ్ జీ శ‌త‌ జ‌యంతిని గురించి తెలుసుకోవాల‌నుకుంటున్న‌ట్టు ఆయ‌న రాశారు.\nనా ప్రియ‌మైన దేశ‌వాసులారా.. మ‌హాపురుషుల జీవితాలు ఎప్పుడూ, ఎల్ల‌ప్పుడూ మ‌న‌కి స్ఫూర్తిదాయ‌కంగా ఉంటాయి. ఇంకా మ‌న ప‌నేమిటంటే మ‌హాత్ముల వైఖ‌రుల‌ను, ఆలోచ‌న‌ల‌ను మ‌దింపు చేయ‌డం మ‌న ప‌ని కాదు. దేశం కోసం జీవించి, మ‌ర‌ణించే వారిలో ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రూ మ‌న‌కు స్ఫూర్తి ప్ర‌దాత‌లే. ఇప్పుడైతే ఎంద‌రో మ‌హాపురుషుల్ని స్మ‌రించుకునే అవ‌కాశం వ‌స్తోంది. సెప్టెంబ‌ర్ 25న పండిత్ దీన్ ద‌యాళ్ ఉపాధ్యాయ‌, అక్టోబ‌ర్ 2న మ‌హాత్మ గాంధీ, శ్రీ‌ లాల్ బ‌హ‌దూర్ శాస్త్రి, 11న శ్రీ‌ జ‌య ప్ర‌కాశ్ నారాయ‌ణ‌, అక్టోబ‌ర్ 31న స‌ర్దార్ వ‌ల్ల‌భ్ భాయ్ ప‌టేల్‌…. ఎన్ని లెక్క‌లేన‌న్ని పేర్లున్నాయో చూడండి. నేనైతే చాలా చెబుతున్నాను. ఎందుకంటే దేశం ర‌త్న‌గ‌ర్భ‌. మీరేదైనా తేదీ చెప్పండి. చ‌రిత్ర పుట‌లలో నుండి ఎవ‌రో ఒక మ‌హాపురుషుని పేరు దొర‌క‌నే దొరుకుతుంది. రానున్న రోజుల్లో ఈ మ‌హాత్ములంద‌రినీ మ‌నం గుర్తు చేసుకుందాం. వారి జీవిత సందేశాల‌ను ఇంటింటికీ చేరుద్దాం. వారి నుండి ఎంతో కొంత నేర్చుకునే ప్ర‌య‌త్నం చేద్దాం. ముఖ్యంగా – అక్టోబ‌ర్ 2 విష‌యం నేను మ‌రోసారి విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేస్తున్నాను. అక్టోబ‌ర్ 2 పూజ్య బాపూజీ జ‌యంతి. నిరుడు కూడా నేను చెప్పాను. మీ ద‌గ్గ‌ర అన్ని ర‌కాల ఫ్యాష‌న్ దుస్తులు ఉండి ఉంటాయి. అన్ని ర‌కాల ఫ్యాబ్రిక్ ఉంటుంది. చాలా వ‌స్తువులు ఉంటాయి. కానీ వాటిలో ఖ‌ద్ద‌రుకు కూడా స్థానం ఉండాలి. నేను మ‌రోసారి చెబుతున్నాను. అక్టోబ‌ర్ 2 నుండి నెల రోజులపాటు ఖ‌ద్ద‌రు మీద రాయితీ ఉంటుంది. దీని నుండి లబ్ధిని పొందండి. ఖాదీతో పాటు… చేనేత‌ల‌కు అంతే ప్రాధాన్యం ఇవ్వండి. మ‌న చేనేత‌ సోద‌రులు ఎంతో శ్ర‌మ ప‌డుతున్నారు. నూట పాతిక కోట్ల మంది దేశ‌వాసులం… 5 రూపాయ‌లో, ప‌దో, యాభై రూపాయ‌ల‌తోనైనా ఏదైనా చేనేత లేదా ఖాదీ వ‌స్తువు కొంటే, అదంతా చివ‌రికి ఆ ఖాదీ నేత‌ కార్మికులకు చెందుతుంది; ఖాదీ వ‌స్త్రం త‌యారుచేసే పేదింటి వితంతువుల‌కు చేరుతుంది. అందుకే ఈసారి దీపావ‌ళి పండుగ‌కు మ‌నం ఖాదీకి మ‌న ఇంట్లో స్థానం క‌ల్పిద్దాం. ఖ‌ద్ద‌రు బ‌ట్ట‌లు ధ‌రిద్దాం. మీరు పూర్తిగా ఖాదీ ధ‌రించాల‌ని నేను చెప్ప‌డం లేదు. కొంత‌ వరకైనా దీనిని ఆదరించండి. అంతే నేను విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేసేది. ఇంకా చూడండి. క్రితం సారి అమ్మ‌కాలు దాదాపు రెట్టింప‌య్యాయి. ఎంత మంది పేద‌ల‌కు ల‌బ్ధిని చేకూరిందో. ప్ర‌భుత్వం కోట్లాది రూపాయ‌లు ఖ‌ర్చుచేసి ప్ర‌క‌ట‌న‌ల‌తో చేయ‌లేని పనిని మీ ప్ర‌జ‌లు చిన్న‌పాటి మ‌ద్ద‌తుతో సాధించారు. ఇదే జ‌న‌ శ‌క్తి అంటే. అందుకే నేను మ‌రోసారి ఆ ప‌ని కోసం మిమ్మ‌ల్ని అభ్య‌ర్థిస్తున్నాను.\nప్రియ‌మైన దేశ‌వాసులారా…. ఒక విష‌యంలో నా మ‌న‌స్సు ఆనందంతో నిండిపోయింది. ఆ ఆనందాన్ని మీకు కూడా కొంచెం పంచాల‌నిపిస్తోంది. నేను మే నెల‌లో కోల్‌క‌తా కు వెళ్లిన‌ప్పుడు శ్రీ‌ సుభాష్ చంద్ర బోస్ కుటుంబ స‌భ్యులు వ‌చ్చి క‌లిశారు. ఆయ‌న సోద‌రుని కుమారుడు శ్రీ‌ చంద్ర బోస్ అంతా ఏర్పాటుచేశారు. శ్రీ‌ సుభాష్ బాబు కుటుంబ స‌భ్యుల‌తో సంతోషంగా, ఉల్లాసంగా ఆ సాయంత్రం గ‌డిపే అవ‌కాశం ల‌భించింది. ఆ రోజు నిర్ణ‌యం జ‌రిగింది. శ్రీ‌ సుభాష్ బోసు కుటుంబం అంతా ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి నివాసానికి రావాల‌ని. శ్రీ‌ చంద్ర‌బోస్, ఇంకా వారి కుటుంబ స‌భ్యులు ఆ ఏర్పాట్ల‌లో ఉన్నారు. 50 మందికి పైగా సుభాష్ బోసు కుటుంబ స‌భ్యులు ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి నివాసానికి వ‌చ్చే విష‌యం గ‌త వారం ఖ‌రారైంది. అది నాకెంతో ఆనందం క‌లిగించే క్ష‌ణాలు అవి. మీరు ఊహించ‌గ‌ల‌రు. నేతాజీ కుటుంబ స‌భ్యులంద‌రూ క‌ల‌సి, ఒకేసారి ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి నివాసానికి వ‌చ్చే అవ‌కాశం బ‌హుశా మొద‌టిసారి ల‌భించింది. కానీ దానికంటే ఆనందం క‌లిగించే విష‌యం ఏమిటంటే – అలాంటి మ‌హా మ‌నిషి ప‌రివారానికి ఆతిథ్యం ఇచ్చే అవ‌కాశం. ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి నివాసానికి వారు ఎప్పుడూ వ‌చ్చి ఉండ‌దు. అది నాకు అక్టోబ‌ర్‌లో ద‌క్క‌బోతోంది. వేరు వేరు దేశాల్లో ఉంటున్న 50 మందికి పైగా శ్రీ‌ సుభాష్ బాబు కుటుంబ స‌భ్యులు ఇందుకోస‌మే ప్ర‌త్యేకంగా వ‌స్తున్నారు. అది నాకెంతో ఆనందం ఇచ్చే క్ష‌ణ‌మే క‌దా అది. వారిని ఆహ్వానించడం కోసం ఎంతో ఆనందానుభూతిని పొందుతున్నాను నేను.\nభార్గ‌వి కాన‌డే నుంచి నా కోసం దేశం వ‌చ్చింది. ఇంకా ఆమె చెప్పిన తీరు, కంఠ‌స్వ‌రం, అంతా విన్నాక నాకేమ‌నిపించిందంటే – ఆమె ఒక నాయ‌కురాలు అనిపించింది, నాయ‌కురాలు అవుతుందేమోన‌నిపిస్తోంది.\n“నా పేరు భార్గ‌వి కాన‌డే. నేను ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి గారికి విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి చేయ‌ద‌లిచాను. యువ‌త‌రం ఓట‌రుగా న‌మోదు చేసుకునేందుకు చైత‌న్య‌ప‌ర‌చండి. రానున్న కాలంలో దీనివ‌ల్ల యువ‌త‌రం భాగ‌స్వామ్యం పెరుగుతుంది. భ‌విష్య‌త్ లో ప్ర‌భుత్వాన్ని ఎన్నుకోవ‌డంలో యువ‌త‌రం కీల‌క భాగ‌స్వామ్యం ఉంటుంది. ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు” అని.\nవోట‌ర్ల జాబితాలో పేరు న‌మోదు చేసుకోవ‌డం, వోటు వేయ‌డం గురించి భార్గ‌వి చెబుతున్నారు. మీరు చెప్పేది నిజ‌మే. ప్ర‌జాస్వామ్యంలో ప్ర‌తి వోట‌రూ దేశ భాగ్య విధాత అవుతారు. ఈ చైత‌న్యం పెరుగుతోంది. వోటింగ్ శాతం కూడా పెరుగుతోంది. ఇందుకుగాను ముఖ్యంగా – భార‌త దేశ ఎన్నికల సంఘానికి అభినంద‌న‌లు చెప్పాల‌నుకుంటున్నాను. కొన్నేళ్ళ క్రితం మ‌న ఎన్నిక‌ల సంఘం కేవ‌లం నియంత్ర‌ణ సంస్థ‌గా ప‌నిచేయ‌డం చూసేవాళ్లం. కానీ గ‌త కొన్నేళ్లుగా ఈ స్థితిలో చాలా మార్పు వ‌చ్చింది. ఇప్పుడు మ‌న ఎన్నిక‌ల సంఘం నియంత్ర‌ణ సంస్థ మాత్ర‌మే కాదు. ఒక ర‌కంగా ఫెసిలిటేట‌ర్‌గా మారింది. వోట‌రు సానుకూల సంస్థ‌గా మారింది. వారి ఆలోచ‌న‌లు, ప్ర‌ణాళిక‌ల్లో ఇప్పుడు వోట‌రే కేంద్ర బిందువుగా మారాడు. ఇదొక మంచి మార్పు. కానీ ఎన్నిక‌ల సంఘం ఒక్క‌టే ప‌ని చేస్తుంటే ప‌ని న‌డ‌వ‌దు. మ‌నం కూడా బడి, కళాశాల, వీధులలో ఈ చైత‌న్యం నింపాలి. ఎన్నిక‌లొచ్చిన‌ప్పుడే చైత‌న్యం తేవాల‌నుకోవ‌డం స‌రికాదు. వోట‌రు జాబితాలు ఎప్ప‌టిక‌ప్పుడు అప్ గ్రేడ్ అవుతూ ఉండాలి. తాజా ప‌రిచేలా మ‌నం కూడా చూస్తూ ఉండాలి.\nనాకు ల‌భించిన అమూల్య అధికారం అది సుర‌క్షితంగా ఉందా… లేదా… నా అధికారాన్ని నేను ఉప‌యోగిస్తున్నానా… లేదా… అని త‌రచి చూసుకునే అల‌వాటు మ‌న‌మంద‌రం చేసుకోవాలి. దేశ యువ‌జ‌నులు వోట‌ర్ల జాబితాలో వారి పేర్లు న‌మోదు చేసుకోన‌ట్ల‌యితే చేసుకోవాల‌ని కోరుతున్నాను. అలాగే వోటు కూడా త‌ప్ప‌కుండా వెయ్యాలి. ఎన్నిక‌ల స‌మ‌యంలో అయితే బ‌హిరంగంగానే చెబుతుంటారు. ముందు వోటు… త‌ర్వాతే తిండీతిప్ప‌లు అని. ఈ ప‌విత్ర‌మైన ప‌నిని ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రూ విధిగా చెయ్యాలి.\nఈ మ‌ధ్య నేను కాశీలో ప‌ర్య‌టించి వ‌చ్చాను. చాలా మందిని క‌లిశాను. చాలా కార్య‌క్ర‌మాలు జ‌రిగాయి. ఎంతో మందిని క‌లిశాను కానీ, ఇద్ద‌రు పిల్ల‌ల గురించి మీతో చెప్పాల‌నుకుంటున్నాను. క్షితిజ్ పాండే అనే ఏడో త‌ర‌గ‌తి విద్యార్థి క‌లిశాడు. బ‌నార‌స్ హిందూ విశ్వ‌విద్యాల‌యంలో కేంద్రీయ విశ్వ‌విద్యాల‌యంలో ఏడో త‌ర‌గ‌తి చ‌దువుతున్నాడు. చాలా తెలివైన‌, చురుకైన‌వాడు. ఆత్మ‌విశ్వాసం కూడా ఎక్కువ‌గానే ఉంది. కానీ – ఇంత చిన్న వ‌య‌సులో భౌతిక‌శాస్త్రం సంబంధిత విష‌యాల‌పై అభిరుచి చూశాను. చాలా చ‌దువుతాడ‌నుకుంటా. ఇంట‌ర్ నెట్‌లో స‌ర్ఫింగ్ చేస్తూ ఉండొచ్చు. కొత్త కొత్త ప్ర‌యోగాలు చేస్తాడ‌నుకుంటా. రైలు ప్ర‌మాదాలు ఎలా అరిక‌ట్టాలి…? ఎలాంటి టెక్నాల‌జీ ఉండాలి…? ఇంధ‌న పొదుపు ఎలా చేయాలి…? ఎలాంటి ప‌రిశోధ‌న‌లు ఉన్నాయి…? రోబో లో భావ‌న‌లు ఎలా వ‌స్తాయి….? ఎలాంటెలాంటి మాట‌లో చెప్పాడు.\nచిచ్చ‌ర పిడుగు అనుకోండి. స‌రే, పిల్లాడు చెప్పేదేంటో లోతుగా చూడ‌లేక‌పోయాడు. అత‌ను చెప్పిన దానిలో సూక్ష్మ ప‌రిజ్ఞానం ఉందో ఏమోకానీ అతని విశ్వాసం, అభిరుచి చూశాను. దేశంలోని పిల్ల‌లంద‌రిలో వైజ్ఞానిక విష‌యాల మీద అభిరుచి పెర‌గాల‌ని అనుకుంటున్నాను. పిల్ల‌ల మ‌న‌సుల్లో ప్ర‌శ్న‌లు ఎల్ల‌ప్పుడూ త‌లెత్తాలి. ఎందుకు….? ఎలా….? ఎప్పుడు….? పిల్ల‌లు మ‌న‌స్సు పెట్టి ఈ ప్ర‌శ్న‌లు అడ‌గాలి.\nఅలాగే సోనం ప‌టేల్.. చాలా చిన్న‌పిల్ల‌. న‌న్ను క‌లిసింది. తనకు తొమ్మిదేళ్లు. వార‌ణాసిలో సంద‌ర్ పూర్ నివాసి. స‌దావృత్ పేట్ కుమార్తె. చాలా పేదింటి పిల్ల‌. ఆమె న‌న్ను అబ్బుర‌ప‌రిచింది. భ‌గ‌వ‌ద్గీత అంతా ఆమెకు కంఠోపాఠం. అన్నిటికంటే చ‌కితుల్ని చేసిన విష‌యం ఏంటంటే…. గీత నుండి అడిగిన శ్లోకం చెప్పింది. ఆంగ్లంలో టీకాటిప్ప‌ణీ చెప్పింది. దాని మీద విశ్లేష‌ణ చెప్పింది. హిందీలో కూడా టిప్పణీ చెప్పింది. ఆమె తండ్రిని అడిగితే చెప్పాడు. ఆ పిల్ల ఐదేళ్ల వ‌య‌సు నుండి ఇలా చెబుతోంద‌ని. ఎక్క‌డ నేర్చుకుంద‌ని అడిగాను. వాళ్ల‌కి కూడా తెలీద‌ని చెప్పారు. మిగ‌తా చ‌దువు ఎలా ఉంద‌ని అడిగాను. భగవద్గీత ఒక్క‌టే చ‌దువుతుందా…. ఇంకా ఏమైనా చేస్తుందా అని అడిగితే వాళ్లు చెప్పారు. గ‌ణితం ఒక‌సారి చేతిలోకి తీసుకుంటే సాయంత్రానికి కంఠ‌తా వ‌స్తాయ‌ని.\nచ‌రిత్ర పాఠం తీసుకుంటే సాయంత్రానికి తిరిగి చెప్పేస్తుంది. కుటుంబంలో ఎవ‌రికీ లేనిది ఆమెకు ఎలా వ‌చ్చిందా అని ఆశ్చ‌ర్య‌పోతామ‌ని వాళ్లు చెప్పారు. నిజంగానే నాకు ముచ్చ‌టేసింది. ఒక్కొక్కసారి కొంత మంది పిల్ల‌ల‌కు విశిష్ట వ్యక్తి అయిపోవాల‌ని అనిపిస్తుంది. సోనంలో అలాంటిదేమీ లేదు. భ‌గ‌వంతుడు త‌న‌కు ఏదో శ‌క్తి త‌ప్ప‌క ఇచ్చాడు అని నాక‌నిపిస్తోంది. స‌రే…. ఈ ఇద్ద‌రు పిల్ల‌ల్ని క‌ల‌వ‌డం నా కాశీ యాత్ర‌లో ఒక విశేషం. అందుకే నాకు అనిపించింది మీకు కూడా చెప్పాల‌ని. టీవీలో మీరు చూసేది, ప‌త్రిక‌ల్లో చ‌దివేది కాకుండా ఇంకా కూడా ఎన్నో ప‌నులు చేస్తూ ఉంటాం. అప్పుడప్పుడు ఇలాంటి ప‌నుల వ‌ల్ల కొంత ఆనందం కలుగుతుంది. అలాగే ఈ ఇద్ద‌రి పిల్ల‌ల‌తో మాట్లాడ‌టం నాకు గుర్తుండిపోతుంది. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) కార్య‌క్ర‌మంలో కొంద‌రు నాకోసం చాలా ప‌ని పెట్ట‌డాన్ని గ‌మ‌నించాను. చూడండి. హ‌రియాణాకి చెందిన శ్రీ‌ సందీప్ ఏం చెబుతున్నాడో..\n‘సందీప్ హ‌ర్యాణా… సార్ మీరు నెల‌కొక‌సారి పాల్గొంటున్న ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ వారానికి ఒక‌సారి ఉండాల‌ని కోరుకుంటున్నాను. ఎందుకంటే మీ మాట‌ల్లో చాలా ప్రేర‌ణ ల‌భిస్తుంది’ అని.\nసందీప్ గారు…. నా చేత ఏమేం చేయిస్తారు. నెల‌కోసారి చేయ‌డానికైనా నాకెంతో క‌ష్ట‌ప‌డాల్సి వ‌స్తోంది. స‌మ‌యాన్ని ఎంతో స‌ర్దుబాటు చేసుకోవ‌ల‌సి వ‌స్తోంది. అప్పుడ‌ప్పుడు మ‌న ఆకాశ‌వాణి స‌హ‌చ‌రులు – అర‌గంట … ముప్పావుగంట… నా కోసం ఎదురుచూస్తూ కూర్చోవ‌ల‌సి వ‌స్తుంది. కానీ – మీ భావ‌న‌ను నేను ఆద‌రిస్తాను. మీ సూచ‌న‌కు నా ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు. ఇప్ప‌టికైతే నెల‌కొక‌సారి స‌రిగ్గా ఉంది.\n‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్’ కార్య‌క్ర‌మానికి ఒక ర‌కంగా సంవ‌త్స‌రం అయింది. మీకు తెలుసు. శ్రీ‌ సుభాష్ బాబు రేడియోను ఎంత‌గా ఉప‌యోగించుకునేవారో మీకు తెలుసా ? జ‌ర్మ‌నీలో ఆయ‌న త‌న సొంత రేడియోను ప్రారంభించారు. హిందుస్థాన్ ప్ర‌జ‌ల స్వాతంత్య్ర పోరాటానికి సంబంధించి ఆయ‌న రేడియో ద్వారా చెబుతూనే ఉండేవారు. ‘ఆజాద్ హింద్ రేడియో’ను వీక్లీ న్యూస్ బులెటిన్‌తో ఆయ‌న మొద‌లుపెట్టారు. ఆంగ్లం, హిందీ, బెంగాలీ, మ‌రాఠీ, పంజాబీ, ప‌శ్తో, ఉర్దూ అన్ని భాష‌ల్లో రేడియోను ఆయ‌న నిర్వ‌హించేవారు.\nనాకు కూడా ఇప్పుడు ఆకాశ‌వాణిలో ‘మ‌న‌సులో మాట‘ కార్యక్రమాన్ని నిర్వహిస్తూ సంవ‌త్సరం అయింది. ‘మ‌న్ కీ బాత్‘ (మ‌న‌సులో మాట) మీ కార‌ణంగా అర్థ‌వంతంగా, మీ ‘మ‌న‌సులో మాట‌‘గా మారింది. మీ మాట‌లు వింటూ ఉంటాను. మీ గురించి ఆలోచిస్తూ ఉంటాను. దాంతోనే నా ఆలోచ‌న‌ల్లో ఒక ప‌రుగు మొద‌ల‌వుతుంది. అది ఆకాశ‌వాణి వేదిక‌గా మీ వ‌ద్ద‌కు చేరుతుంది. ప‌లికేది నేనే, కానీ ఆ ప‌లుకులు మీవే అవుతాయి. అదే క‌దా నా సంతోషం. వ‌చ్చే నెల మ‌న‌సులో మాట కోసం మ‌ళ్లీ క‌లుద్దాం. మీ సూచ‌న‌లైతే అందుతూ ఉండాలి. మీ సూచ‌న‌ల‌తో ప్ర‌భుత్వానికి కూడా లాభం ఉంటుంది. దిద్దుబాటు మొద‌ల‌వుతుంది. మీ భాగ‌స్వామ్యం నాకు ఎంతో విలువైన‌ది, అమూల్య‌మైన‌ది. మ‌ళ్లీ ఒక‌సారి మీ అంద‌రికీ శుభాకాంక్ష‌లు – ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear countrymen, greetings to you all. This is the twelfth episode of “Mann Ki Baat” and in a way it means that we have completed one year. Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”. “Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts. I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.\nIn a democracy the power of the people is of great significance. This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people. But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking. Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual. My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them. I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them. But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs. This in itself is a great power. I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.\nYes …. These lakhs of letters did teach me something more. I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance. I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people. They conducted programmes after that. They called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised. They tried to get certain problems resolved. The various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters, others to personal issues, some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of. Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government. It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom. Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information? But this has happened.\nIn the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society. I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed. Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters? Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them. Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters. This was a kind of a silent revolution.\nI had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them. People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India. Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage. All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny. The people themselves took the task forward.\nIn October last year, I did my first “Mann Ki Baat”. In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhiji’s birth Anniversary on 2nd October. There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation? Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion? I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled. Now see, there was no government advertisement. Nor were lakhs and crores spent. A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.\nOnce I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit. Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders? And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy. Just think…Today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people. I saw on T.V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy. The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy. Isn’t it a silent revolution? Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?\nThe governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration. There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society. “Mann Ki Baat” has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again I would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform. They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country. Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?\nThis time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat. I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded. I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat. I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country – be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari. There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call. This is a pleasant experience in itself. People of all age groups have sent messages. I listened to some message personally and I liked them. My team is working on the others. You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important. The entire government will work on your suggestions.\nBut there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy. It feels as if there is negativity all around us. But my experience was different. These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way. It was frank interaction where they could say anything but I am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat. They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive. Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude; this is the nation’s greatest wealth. There were serious complaints in about 1-2% phone calls. But more than 90% things were energizing and pleasant.\nAnother thing came to my mind, for the specially–abled. And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls. The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio. This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people. I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.\nPawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message. I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it. Please hear what he wants to say-\n“My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan. I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali. This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families. Thank you.\nPawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India. It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless. So the earthen lamps will be valuable too. It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home. Poor people earn their living this way. I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.\nMy dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces. The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965. To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate. I saw it with immense interest. I went there for half an hour but when I came out it was more than 2.5 hours and I felt like seeing more. What was it that was not there? The entire history has been brought to life. From aesthetic perspective it was excellent, from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this. At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.\nWhether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers. I had the opportunity to meet the brave families, families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives. They too had come and when I was shaking hands, it was filled with great energy was very inspiring. If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past. History binds us to our roots. If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end. This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past. It gives us knowledge about our history. And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history. This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it. And do not be in haste like me. I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.\nLook at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry. I do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought, not only should the Prime Minister think about what he said but every Indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say:\n“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.\nThis child is absolutely right. We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness. I got great satisfaction from this child’s message. On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days. Our government is criticized as well. I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?” I don’t get offended by all this. I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.\nLook at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment that’s building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work. The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.\nDo you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say? He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”. Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom. Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish. Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.\nHe has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us. It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men. Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us. In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men. 25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.\nYou pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history. We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.\nI would like to request you for 2nd October specially. It’s the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi. I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month. You must all avail this sale. Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.\nOur weavers put in a lot of hard work. If we, 1.5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs. 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver. It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali. I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi. But have a few collection…. this is my only request. Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale. A lot of the poor have been benefitted. Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help. This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.\nDear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing. I wish to share this joy with you as well. I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me. His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything. I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members. That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence. Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.\nYou can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news. Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time. More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Minister’s residence to offer its hospitality. More than 50 family members of Subhash Babu’s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting. It is going to be a joyous moment for me. I am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy.\nI received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.\n“My name is Bhargavi Kande. I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voter’s registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government. Thank you”\nBhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter’s list and the voting process. In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually. The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India. Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies. It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do. We must mobilize schools, colleges and societies – we must spread awareness always, not only during the time of elections. The voter’s list must be updated; we must also keep a watch on it. This priceless right that I have, is it safe? Am I using it or not? We must all develop this habit. I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter’s list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too. I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food. This is a holy act, everyone must do it.\nI have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday. I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events. I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today. One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University. He is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level. At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics. I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments. He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not. He was an amazing kid. Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things. I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science. Kids should be very inquisitive, why? How? When? A kid should always ask these questions.\nSimilarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel. She is 9 years old. She is the daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi. Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old. I asked where she learned it from. They said, “We do not have any idea.” Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well? Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening. He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has. I was really very impressed. Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities; Sonam did not have any such obsessions. I felt this girl is God-gifted.\nMeeting these kids was a very special experience that I had on my Kashi visit. So, I thought I must share it with you. We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers. Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well. Similarly, I will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids.\nI noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’\nLook what Sandeep from Haryana has to say, “Sir, I want you to do ‘Mann ki Baat’ a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words.”\nSandeep ji, what all will you make me do? I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table. Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so. I still respect your feelings. I am thankful to you for your suggestion. For now, we will stick to the one month program only.\n‘Mann Ki Baat’ in a way has completed a year. Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio? He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio. He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin. English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.\nI have also completed a year since I started ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ My ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in the true sense become your ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani. I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction. We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’ Your suggestions should keep coming in. The government gets benefited by your suggestions. It helps to initiate improvement. Your contribution is priceless for me.\nOnce again, many congratulations to all of you. Thank you!\n"
