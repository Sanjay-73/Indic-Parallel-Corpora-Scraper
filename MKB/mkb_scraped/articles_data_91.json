        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

        "article": "\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नमस्कार! आप रेडियो पर मेरी ‘मन की बात’ सुनते होंगे, लेकिन दिमाग इस बात पर लगा होगा – बच्चों के exam शुरू हो रहे हैं, कुछ लोगों के दसवीं-बारहवीं के exam शायद 1 मार्च को ही शुरू हो रहे हैं। तो आपके दिमाग में भी वही चलता होगा। मैं भी आपकी इस यात्रा में आपके साथ शरीक होना चाहता हूँ। आपको आपके बच्चों के exam की जितनी चिंता है, मुझे भी उतनी ही चिंता है। लेकिन अगर हम exam को, परीक्षा को देखने का अपना तौर-तरीका बदल दें, तो शायद हम चिंतामुक्त भी हो सकते हैं।\nमैंने पिछली मेरी ‘मन की बात’ में कहा था कि आप NarendraModiApp पर अपने अनुभव, अपने सुझाव मुझे अवश्य भेजिए। मुझे खुशी इस बात की है – शिक्षकों ने, बहुत ही सफल जिनकी करियर रही है ऐसे विद्यार्थियों ने, माँ-बाप ने, समाज के कुछ चिंतकों ने बहुत सारी बातें मुझे लिख कर के भेजी हैं। दो बातें तो मुझे छू गईं कि सब लिखने वालों ने विषय को बराबर पकड़ के रखा। दूसरी बात इतनी हजारों मात्रा में चीज़ें आई कि मैं मानता हूँ कि शायद ये बहुत महत्वपूर्ण विषय है। लेकिन ज़्यादातर हमने exam के विषय को स्कूल के परिसर तक या परिवार तक या विद्यार्थी तक सीमित कर दिया है। मेरी App पर जो सुझाव आये, उससे तो लगता है कि ये तो बहुत ही बड़ा, पूरे राष्ट्र में लगातार विद्यार्थियों के इन विषयों की चर्चायें होती रहनी चाहिए।\nमैं आज मेरी इस ‘मन की बात’ में विशेष रूप से माँ-बाप के साथ, परीक्षार्थियों के साथ और उनके शिक्षकों के साथ बातें करना चाहता हूँ। जो मैंने सुना है, जो मैंने पढ़ा है, जो मुझे बताया गया है, उसमें से भी कुछ बातें बताऊंगा। कुछ मुझे जो लगता है, वो भी जोड़ूंगा। लेकिन मुझे विश्वास है कि जिन विद्यार्थियों को exam देनी है, उनके लिए मेरे ये 25-30 मिनट बहुत उपयोगी होंगे, ऐसा मेरा मत है।\nमेरे प्यारे विद्यार्थी मित्रो, मैं कुछ कहूँ, उसके पहले आज की ‘मन की बात’ का opening, हम विश्व के well-known opener के साथ क्यूँ न करें। जीवन में सफलता की ऊँचाइयों को पाने में कौन-सी चीज़ें उनको काम आईं, उनके अनुभव आपको ज़रूर काम आएँगे। भारत के युवाओं को जिनके प्रति नाज़ है, ऐसे भारतरत्न श्रीमान सचिन तेंदुलकर, उन्होंने जो message भेजा है, वह मैं आपको सुनाना चाहता हूँ: –\n“नमस्कार, मैं सचिन तेंदुलकर बोल रहा हूँ। मुझे पता है कि exams कुछ ही दिनों में start होने वाली हैं। आप में से कई लोग tense भी रहेंगे। मेरा एक ही message है आपको कि आपसे expectations आपके माता-पिता करेंगे, आपके teachers करेंगे, आपके बाकी के family members करेंगे, दोस्त करेंगे। जहाँ भी जाओगे, सब पूछेंगे कि आपकी तैयारी कैसी चल रही है, कितने percent आपका स्कोर करोगे। यही कहना चाहूँगा मैं कि आप ख़ुद अपने लिए कुछ target set कीजियेगा, किसी और के expectation के pressure में मत आइयेगा। आप मेहनत ज़रूर कीजियेगा, मगर एक realistic achievable target खुद के लिए सेट कीजिये और वो target achieve करने के लिए कोशिश करना। मैं जब Cricket खेलता था, तो मेरे से भी बहुत सारे expectations होते थे। पिछले 24 साल में कई सारे कठिन moments आये और कई-कई बार अच्छे moments आये, मगर लोगों के expectations हमेशा रहते थे और वो बढ़ते ही गये, जैसे समय बीतता गया, expectations भी बढ़ते ही गए। तो इसके लिए मुझे एक solution find करना बहुत ज़रूरी था। तो मैंने यही सोचा कि मैं मेरे खुद के expectations रखूँगा और खुद के targets set करूँगा। अगर वो मेरे खुद के targets मैं set कर रहा हूँ और वो achieve कर पा रहा हूँ, तो मैं ज़रूर कुछ-न-कुछ अच्छी चीज़ देश के लिए कर पा रहा हूँ। और वो ही targets मैं हमेशा achieve करने की कोशिश करता था। मेरा focus रहता था ball पे और targets अपने आप slowly-slowly achieve होते गए। मैं आपको यही कहूँगा कि आप, आपकी सोच positive होनी बहुत ज़रूरी है। positive सोच को positive results follow करेंगे। तो आप positive ज़रूर रहियेगा और ऊपर वाला आपको ज़रूर अच्छे results दे, ये मुझे, इसकी पूरी उम्मीद है और आपको मैं best wishes देना चाहूँगा exams के लिए। एक tens।on free जा के पेपर लिखिये और अच्छे results पाइये। Good Luck!”\nदोस्तो, देखा, तेंदुलकर जी क्या कह रहे हैं। ये expectation के बोझ के नीचे मत दबिये। आप ही को तो आपका भविष्य बनाना है। आप खुद से अपने लक्ष्य को तय करें, खुद ही अपने target तय करें – मुक्त मन से, मुक्त सोच से, मुक्त सामर्थ्य से। मुझे विश्वास है कि सचिन जी की ये बात आपको काम आएगी। और ये बात सही है | प्रतिस्पर्द्धा क्यों? अनुस्पर्द्धा क्यों नहीं। हम दूसरों से स्पर्द्धा करने में अपना समय क्यों बर्बाद करें। हम खुद से ही स्पर्द्धा क्यों न करें। हम अपने ही पहले के सारे रिकॉर्ड तोड़ने का तय क्यों न करें। आप देखिये, आपको आगे बढ़ने से कोई रोक नहीं पायेगा और अपने ही पिछले रिकॉर्ड को जब तोड़ोगे, तब आपको खुशी के लिए, संतोष के लिए किसी और से अपेक्षा भी नहीं रहेगी। एक भीतर से संतोष प्रकट होगा।\nदोस्तो, परीक्षा को अंकों का खेल मत मानिये। कहाँ पहुँचे, कितना पहुँचे? उस हिसाब-किताब में मत फँसे रहिये। जीवन को तो किसी महान उद्देश्य के साथ जोड़ना चाहिए। एक सपनों को ले कर के चलना चाहिए, संकल्पबद्ध होना चाहिए। ये परीक्षाएँ, वो तो हम सही जा रहे हैं कि नहीं जा रहे, उसका हिसाब-किताब करती हैं; हमारी गति ठीक है कि नहीं है, उसका हिसाब-किताब करती हैं। और इसलिए विशाल, विराट ये अगर सपने रहें, तो परीक्षा अपने आप में एक आनंदोत्सव बन जायेगी। हर परीक्षा उस महान उद्देश्य की पूर्ति का एक कदम होगी। हर सफलता उस महान उद्देश्य को प्राप्त करने की चाभी बन जायेगी। और इसलिए इस वर्ष क्या होगा, इस exam में क्या होगा, वहाँ तक सीमित मत रहिये। एक बहुत बड़े उद्देश्य को ले कर के चलिये और उसमें कभी अपेक्षा से कुछ कम भी रह जाएगा, तो निराशा नहीं आएगी। और ज़ोर लगाने की, और ताक़त लगाने की, और कोशिश करने की हिम्मत आएगी।\nजिन हज़ारों लोगों ने मुझे मेरे App पर मोबाइल फ़ोन से छोटी-छोटी बातें लिखी हैं। श्रेय गुप्ता ने इस बात पर बल दिया है कि स्वस्थ शरीर में ही स्वस्थ मन रहता है। students अपनी पढ़ाई के साथ-साथ अपनी health का भी ध्यान रखें, जिससे आप exam में स्वस्थतापूर्वक अच्छे से लिख सकें। अब मैं आज आखिरी दिन ये तो नहीं कहूँगा कि आप दंड-बैठक लगाना शुरू कर दीजिये और तीन किलोमीटर, पाँच किलोमीटर दौड़ने के लिए जाइये। लेकिन एक बात सही है कि खास कर के exam के दिनों मे आप का routine कैसा है। वैसे भी 365 दिवस हमारा routine हमारे सपनों और संकल्पों के अनुकूल होना चाहिये। श्रीमान प्रभाकर रेड्डी जी की एक बात से मैं सहमत हूँ। उन्होंने ख़ास आग्रह किया हैं, समय पर सोना चाहिए और सुबह जल्दी उठकर revision करना चाहिए। examination centre पर प्रवेश-पत्र और दूसरी चीजों के साथ समय से पहले पहुँच जाना चाहिए। ये बात प्रभाकर रेड्डी जी ने कही है, मैं शायद कहने की हिम्मत नहीं करता, क्योंकि मैं सोने के संबंध में थोड़ा उदासीन हूँ और मेरे काफ़ी दोस्त भी मुझे शिकायत करते रहते हैं कि आप बहुत कम सोते हैं। ये मेरी एक कमी है, मैं भी ठीक करने की कोशिश करूँगा। लेकिन मैं इससे सहमत ज़रूर हूँ। निर्धारित सोने का समय, गहरी नींद – ये उतनी ही महत्वपूर्ण है जितनी कि आपकी दिन भर की और गतिविधियाँ और ये संभव है। मैं भाग्यवान हूँ, मेरी नींद कम है, लेकिन बहुत गहरी ज़रूर है और इसके लिए मेरा काम चल भी जाता है। लेकिन आपसे तो मैं आग्रह करूँगा। वरना कुछ लोगों की आदत होती है, सोने से पहले लम्बी-लम्बी टेलीफ़ोन पर बात करते रहते हैं। अब उसके बाद वही विचार चलते रहते हैं, तो कहाँ से नींद आएगी? और जब मैं सोने की बात करता हूँ, तो ये मत सोचिए कि मैं exam के लिए सोने के लिए कहा रहा हूँ। गलतफ़हमी मत करना। मैं exam के time पर तो आपको अच्छी परीक्षा देने के लिए तनावमुक्त अवस्था के लिए सोने की बात कर रहा हूँ। सोते रहने की बात नहीं कर रहा हूँ। वरना कहीं ऐसा न हो कि marks कम आ जाये और माँ पूछे कि क्यों बेटे, कम आये, तो कह दो कि मोदी जी ने सोने को कहा था, तो मैं तो सो गया था। ऐसा नहीं करोगे न! मुझे विश्वास है नहीं करोगे।\nवैसे जीवन में, discipline सफलताओं की आधारशिला को मजबूत बनाने का बहुत बड़ा कारण होती है। एक मजबूत foundation discipline से आता है। और जो unorganized होते हैं, Indiscipline होते हैं, सुबह करने वाला काम शाम को करते हैं, दोपहर को करने वाला काम रात देर से करते हैं, उनको ये तो लगता है कि काम हो गया, लेकिन इतनी energy waste होती है और हर पल तनाव रहता है। हमारे शरीर में भी एक-आध अंग, हमारे body का एक-आध part थोड़ी-सी तकलीफ़ करे, तो आपने देखा होगा कि पूरा शरीर सहजता नहीं अनुभव करता है। इतना ही नहीं, हमारा routine भी चरमरा जाता है। और इसलिए किसी चीज़ को हम छोटी न मानें। आप देखिये, अपने-आपको कभी जो निर्धारित है, उसमें compromise करने की आदत में मत फंसाइए। तय करें, करके देखें।\nदोस्तो, कभी-कभी मैंने देखा है कि जो student exam के लिए जाते हैं, दो प्रकार के student होते हैं, एक, उसने क्या पढ़ा है, क्या सीखा है, किन बातों में उसकी अच्छी ताक़त है – उन चीजों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करते हैं। दूसरे प्रकार के student होते हैं – यार, पता नहीं कौन-सा सवाल आयेगा, पता नहीं कैसा सवाल आयेगा, पता नहीं कर पाऊंगा कि नहीं कर पाऊंगा, पेपर भारी होगा कि हल्का होगा? ये दो प्रकार के लोग देखे होंगे आपने। जो कैसा पेपर आयेगा, उसके tension में रहता है, उसका उसके परिणाम पर भी नकारात्मक प्रभाव होता है। जो मेरे पास क्या है, उसी विश्वास से जाता है, तो कुछ भी आ जाये, वो निपट लेता है। इस बात को मुझसे भी अच्छी तरह अगर कोई कह सकता है, तो checkmate करने में जिनकी मास्टरी है और दुनिया के अच्छों-अच्छों को जिसने checkmate कर दिया है, ऐसे Chess के champ।on विश्वनाथन आनंद, वो अपने अनुभव बतायेंगे। आइये, इस exam में आप checkmate करने का तरीका उन्हीं से सीख लीजिए: –\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nविश्वनाथन आनंद ने सचमुच में बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण बात बताई है और आपने भी जब उनको अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय Chess के गेम में देखा होगा, कितनी स्वस्थता से वो बैठे होते हैं और कितने ध्यानस्थ होते हैं। आपने देखा होगा, उनकी आँखें भी इधर-उधर नहीं जाती हैं। कभी हम सुनते थे न, अर्जुन के जीवन की घटना कि पक्षी की आँख पर कैसे उनकी नज़र रहती थी। बिलकुल वैसे ही विश्वनाथन को जब खेलते हुए देखते हैं, तो बिलकुल उनकी आँखें एकदम से बड़ी target पर fix रहती हैं और वो भीतर की शांति की अभिव्यक्ति होती है। ये बात सही है कि कोई कह दे, इसलिये फिर भीतर की शांति आ ही जायेगी, ये तो कहना कठिन है। लेकिन कोशिश करनी चाहिये! हँसते-हँसते क्यों न करें! आप देखिये, आप हँसते रहेंगे, खिलखिलाहट हँसते रहेंगे exam के दिन भी, अपने-आप शांति आना शुरू हो जाएगी। आप दोस्तों से बात नहीं कर रहे हैं या अकेले चल रहे हैं, मुरझाए-मुरझाए चल रहे हैं, ढेर सारी किताबों को last moment भी हिला रहे हैं, तो-तो फिर वो शांत मन हो नहीं सकता है। हँसिए, बहुत हँसते चलिए, साथियों के साथ चुटकले share करते चलिए, आप देखिए, अपने-आप शांति का माहौल खड़ा हो जाएगा।\nमैं आपको एक बात छोटी सी समझाना चाहता हूँ। आप कल्पना कीजिये कि एक तालाब के किनारे पर आप खड़े हैं और नीचे बहुत बढ़िया चीज़ें दिखती हैं। लेकिन अचानक कोई पत्थर मार दे पानी में और पानी हिलना शुरू हो जाए, तो नीचे जो बढ़िया दिखता था, वो दिखता है क्या? अगर पानी शांत है, तो चीज़ें कितनी ही गहरी क्यों न हों, दिखाई देती हैं। लेकिन पानी अगर अशांत है, तो नीचे कुछ नहीं दिखता है। आपके भीतर बहुत-कुछ पड़ा हुआ है। साल भर की मेहनत का भण्डार भरा पड़ा है। लेकिन अशांत मन होगा, तो वो खज़ाना आप ही नहीं खोज पाओगे। अगर शांत मन रहा, तो वो आपका खज़ाना बिलकुल उभर करके आपके सामने आएगा और आपकी exam एकदम सरल हो जायेगी।\nमैं एक बात बताऊं मेरी अपनी – मैं कभी-कभी कोई लेक्चर सुनने जाता हूँ या मुझे सरकार में भी कुछ विषय ऐसे होते हैं, जो मैं नहीं जानता हूँ और मुझे काफी concentrate करना पड़ता है। तो कभी-कभी ज्यादा concentrate करके समझने की कोशिश करता हूँ, तो एक भीतर तनाव महसूस करता हूँ। फिर मुझे लगता है, नहीं-नहीं, थोड़ा relax कर जाऊँगा, तो मुझे अच्छा रहेगा। तो मैंने अपने-आप अपनी technique develop की है। बहुत deep breathing कर लेता हूँ। गहरी साँस लेता हूँ। तीन बार-पांच बार गहरी साँस लेता हूँ, समय तो 30 सेकिंड, 40 सेकिंड, 50 सेकिंड जाता है, लेकिन फिर मेरा मन एकदम से शांत हो करके चीज़ों को समझने के लिए तैयार हो जाता है। हो सकता है, ये मेरा अनुभव हो, आपको भी काम आ सकता है।\nरजत अग्रवाल ने एक अच्छी बात बतायी है। वो मेरी App पर लिखते हैं – हम हर दिन कम-से-कम आधा घंटे दोस्तों के साथ, परिवारजनों के साथ relax feel करें। गप्पें मारें। ये बड़ी महत्वपूर्ण बात रजत जी ने बताई है, क्योंकि ज्यादातर हम देखते हैं कि हम जब exam दे करके आते हैं, तो गिनने के लिए बैठ जाते हैं, कितने सही किया, कितना गलत किया। अगर घर में माँ-बाप भी पढ़े लिखे हों और उसमें भी अगर माँ-बाप भी टीचर हों, तो-तो फिर पूरा पेपर फिर से लिखवाते हैं – बताओ, तुमने क्या लिखा, क्या हुआ! सारा जोड़ लगाते हैं, देखो, तुम्हें 40 आएगा कि 80 आएगा, 90 आएगा! आपका दिमाग जो exam हो गयी, उसमें खपा रहता है। आप भी क्या करते हैं, दोस्तों से फ़ोन पर share करते हैं, अरे यार, उसमें तुमने क्या लिखा! अरे यार, उसमें तुम्हारा कैसा गया! अच्छा, तुम्हें क्या लगा। यार, मेरी तो गड़बड़ हो गयी। यार, मैंने तो गलती कर दी। अरे यार, मुझे ये तो मालूम था, लेकिन मुझे याद नहीं आया। हम उसी में फँस जाते हैं। दोस्तो, ये मत कीजिये। exam के समय हो गया, सो हो गया। परिवार के साथ और विषयों पर गप्पें मारिए। पुरानी हँसी-खुशी की यादें ताज़ा कीजिए। कभी माँ-बाप के साथ कहीं गये हों, तो वहाँ के दृश्यों को याद करिए। बिलकुल उनसे निकल करके ही आधा घंटा बिताइए। रजत जी की बात सचमुच में समझने जैसी है।\nदोस्तो, मैं क्या आपको शांति की बात बताऊँ। आज आपको exam देने से पहले एक ऐसे व्यक्ति ने आपके लिए सन्देश भेजा है, वे मूलतः शिक्षक हैं और आज एक प्रकार से संस्कार शिक्षक बने हुए हैं। रामचरितमानस, वर्तमान सन्दर्भ में उसकी व्याख्या करते-करते वो देश और दुनिया में इस संस्कार सरिता को पहुँचाने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं। ऐसे पूज्य मुरारी बापू ने भी विद्यार्थियों के लिए बड़ी महत्वपूर्ण tip भेजी है और वे तो शिक्षक भी हैं, चिन्तक भी हैं और इसलिए उनकी बातों में दोनों का मेल है: –\n“मैं मुरारी बापू बोल रहा हूँ। मैं विद्यार्थी भाइयों-बहनों को यही कहना चाहता हूँ कि परीक्षा के समय में मन पर कोई भी बोझ रखे बिना और बुद्धि का एक स्पष्ट निर्णय करके और चित को एकाग्र करके आप परीक्षा में बैठिये और जो स्थिति आई है, उसको स्वीकार कर लीजिए। मेरा अनुभव है कि परिस्थिति को स्वीकार करने से बहुत हम प्रसन्न रह सकते हैं और खुश रह सकते हैं। आपकी परीक्षा में आप निर्भार और प्रसन्नचित्त आगे बढ़ें, तो ज़रूर सफलता मिलेगी और यदि सफलता न भी मिली, तो भी fail होने की ग्लानि नहीं होगी और सफल होने का गर्व भी होगा। एक शेर कह कर मैं मेरा सन्देश और शुभकामना देता हूँ – लाज़िम नहीं कि हर कोई हो कामयाब ही, जीना भी सीखिए नाकामियों के साथ। हमारे आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री का ये जो ‘मन की बात’ का कार्यक्रम है, उसको मैं बहुत आवकार देता हूँ। सबके लिए मेरी बहुत-बहुत शुभकामना। धन्यवाद।”\nपूज्य मुरारी बापू का मैं भी आभारी हूँ कि उन्होंने बहुत अच्छा सन्देश हम सबको दिया। दोस्तो, आज एक और बात बताना चाहता हूँ। मैं देख रहा हूँ कि इस बार जो मुझे लोगों ने जो अपने अनुभव बताये हैं, उसमें योग की चर्चा अवश्य की है। और ये मेरे लिए खुशी की बात है कि इन दिनों मैं दुनिया में जिस किसी से मिलता हूँ, थोड़ा-सा भी समय क्यों न मिले, योग की थोड़ी सी बात तो कोई न कोई करता ही करता है। दुनिया के किसी भी देश का व्यक्ति क्यों न हो, भारत का कोई व्यक्ति क्यों न हो, तो मुझे अच्छा लगता है कि योग के संबंध में इतना आकर्षण पैदा हुआ है, इतनी जिज्ञासा पैदा हुई है और देखिये, कितने लोगों ने मुझे मेरे मोबाइल App पर, श्री अतनु मंडल, श्री कुणाल गुप्ता, श्री सुशांत कुमार, श्री के. जी. आनंद, श्री अभिजीत कुलकर्णी, न जाने अनगिनत लोगों ने meditation की बात की है, योग पर बल दिया है। खैर दोस्तो, मैं बिलकुल ही आज ही कह दूँ, कल सुबह से योग करना शुरू करो, वो तो आपके साथ अन्याय होगा। लेकिन जो योग करते हैं, वो कम से कम exam है इसलिए आज न करें, ऐसा न करें। करते हैं तो करिये। लेकिन ये बात सही है कि विद्यार्थी जीवन में हो या जीवन का उत्तरार्द्ध हो, अंतर्मन की विकास यात्रा में योग एक बहुत बड़ी चाभी है। सरल से सरल चाभी है। आप ज़रूर उस पर ध्यान दीजिए। हाँ, अगर आप अपने नजदीक में कोई योग के जानकार होंगे, उनको पूछोगे तो exam के दिनों में पहले योग नहीं किया होगा, तो भी दो-चार चीज़ें तो ऐसे बता देंगे, जो आप दो-चार-पाँच मिनट में कर सकते हैं। देखिये, अगर आप कर सकते हैं तो! हाँ, मेरा उसमें विश्वास बहुत है।\nमेरे नौजवान साथियो, आपको परीक्षा हॉल में जाने की बड़ी जल्दी होती है। जल्दी-जल्दी पर अपने bench पर बैठ जाने का मन करता है? क्या ये चीज़ें हड़बड़ी में क्यों करें? अपना पूरे दिन का समय का ऐसा प्रबंधन क्यों न करें कि कहीं ट्रैफिक में रुक जाएँ, तो भी समय पर हम पहुँच ही जाएँ। वर्ना ऐसी चीज़ें एक नया तनाव पैदा करती हैं। और एक बात है, हमें जितना समय मिला है, उसमें जो प्रश्नपत्र है, जो instructions हैं, हमें कभी-कभी लगता है कि ये हमारा समय खा जाएगा। ऐसा नहीं है दोस्तो। आप उन instructions को बारीकी से पढ़िए। दो मिनट-तीन मिनट-पाँच मिनट जाएगी, कोई नुकसान नहीं होगा। लेकिन उससे exam में क्या करना है, उसमें कोई गड़बड़ नहीं होगी और बाद में पछतावा नहीं होगा और मैंने देखा है कि कभी-कभार पेपर आने के बाद भी pattern नयी आयी है, ऐसा पता चलता है, लेकिन पढ़ लेते हैं instructions, तो शायद हम अपने आपको बराबर cope-up कर लेते हैं कि हाँ, ठीक है, चलो, मुझे ऐसे ही जाना है। और मैं आपसे आग्रह करूँगा कि भले आपके पाँच मिनट इसमें जाएँ, लेकिन इसको ज़रूर करें।\nश्रीमान यश नागर, उन्होंने हमारे मोबाइल App पर लिखा है कि जब उन्होनें पहली बार पेपर पढ़ा, तो उन्हें ये काफी कठिन लगा। लेकिन उसी पेपर को दोबारा आत्मविश्वास के साथ, अब यही पेपर मेरे पास है, कोई नये प्रश्न आने वाले नहीं हैं, मुझे इतने ही प्रश्नों से निपटना है और जब दोबारा मैं सोचने लगा, तो उन्होंने लिखा है कि मैं इतनी आसानी से इस पेपर को समझ गया, पहली बार पढ़ा तो लगा कि ये तो मुझे नहीं आता है, लेकिन वही चीज़ दोबारा पढ़ा, तो मुझे ध्यान में आया कि नहीं-नहीं सवाल दूसरे तरीक़े से रखा गया है, लेकिन ये तो वही बात है, जो मैं जानता हूँ। प्रश्नों को समझना ये बहुत आवश्यक होता है। प्रश्नों को न समझने से कभी-कभी प्रश्न कठिन लगता है। मैं यश नागर की इस बात पर बल देता हूँ कि आप प्रश्नों को दो बार पढ़ें, तीन बार पढ़ें, चार बार पढ़ें और आप जो जानते हैं, उसके साथ उसको match करने का प्रयास करें। आप देखिये, वो प्रश्न लिखने से पहले ही सरल हो जाएगा।\nमेरे लिए आज खुशी की बात है कि भारतरत्न और हमारे बहुत ही सम्मानित वैज्ञानिक सी.एन.आर. राव, उन्होंने धैर्य पर बल दिया है। बहुत ही कम शब्दों में लेकिन बहुत ही अच्छा सन्देश हम सभी विद्यार्थियों को उन्होंने दिया है। आइये, राव साहब का message सुनें:-\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nदेखा, एक वैज्ञानिक का बात करने का तरीका कैसा होता है। जो बात कहने में मैं आधा घंटा लगाता हूँ, वो बात वो तीन मिनट में कह देते हैं। यही तो विज्ञान की ताकत है और यही तो वैज्ञानिक मन की ताकत है। मैं राव साहब का बहुत आभारी हूँ कि उन्होंने देश के बच्चों को प्रेरित किया। उन्होंने जो बात कही है – दृढ़ता की, निष्ठा की, तप की, यही बात है – dedication, determination, diligence. डटे रहो, दोस्तो, डटे रहो। अगर आप डटे रहोगे, तो डर भी डरता रहेगा। और अच्छा करने के लिए सुनहरा भविष्य आपका इन्तजार कर रहा है।\nअब मेरे App पर एक सन्देश रुचिका डाबस ने अपने exam experience को share किया है। उन्होंने कहा कि उनके परिवार में exam के समय एक positive atmosphere बनाने का लगातार प्रयास होता है और ये चर्चा उनके साथी परिवारों में भी होती थी। सब मिला करके positive वातावरण। ये बात सही है, जैसा सचिन जी ने भी कहा, positive approach, positive frame of mind positive energy को उजागर करता है।\nकभी-कभी बहुत सी बातें ऐसी होती हैं कि जो हमें प्रेरणा देती हैं, और ये मत सोचिए कि ये सब विद्यार्थियों को ही प्रेरणा देती हैं। जीवन के किसी भी पड़ाव पर आप क्यों न हों, उत्तम उदाहरण, सत्य घटनाएँ बहुत बड़ी प्रेरणा भी देती हैं, बहुत बड़ी ताकत भी देती हैं और संकट के समय नया रास्ता भी बना देती हैं। हम सब electricity bulb के आविष्कारक थॉमस एलवा एडिसन, हमारे syllabus में उसके विषय में पढ़ते हैं। लेकिन दोस्तो, कभी ये सोचा है, कितने सालों तक उन्होंने इस काम को करने के लिए खपा दिए। कितनी बार विफलताएँ मिली, कितना समय गया, कितने पैसे गए। विफलता मिलने पर कितनी निराशा आयी होगी। लेकिन आज उस electricity, वो bulb हम लोगों की ज़िंदगी को भी तो रोशन करता है। इसी को तो कहते हैं, विफलता में भी सफलता की संभावनायें निहित होती हैं।\nश्रीनिवास रामानुजन को कौन नहीं जानता है। आधुनिक काल के महानतम गणित विचारकों में से एक नाम –Indian Mathematician. आपको पता होगा, उनका formal कोई education mathematics में नहीं हुआ था, कोई विशेष प्रशिक्षण भी नहीं हुआ था, लेकिन उन्होंने Mathematical analysis, number theory जैसे विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में गहन योगदान किया। अत्यंत कष्ट भरा जीवन, दुःख भरा जीवन, उसके बावज़ूद भी वो दुनिया को बहुत-कुछ दे करके गए।\nजे. के. रॉलिंग एक बेहतरीन उदाहरण हैं कि सफलता कभी भी किसी को भी मिल सकती है। हैरी पॉटर series आज दुनिया भर में लोकप्रिय है। लेकिन शुरू से ऐसा नहीं था। कितनी समस्या उनको झेलनी पड़ी थी। कितनी विफलताएँ आई थीं। रॉलिंग ने खुद कहा था कि मुश्किलों में वो सारी ऊर्जा उस काम में लगाती थीं, जो वाकई उनके लिए मायने रखता था।\nExam आजकल सिर्फ़ विद्यार्थी की नहीं, पूरे परिवार की और पूरे स्कूल की, teacher की सबकी हो जाती है। लेकिन parents और teachers के support system के बिना अकेला विद्यार्थी, स्थिति अच्छी नहीं है। teacher हो, parents हों, even senior students हों, ये सब मिला करके हम एक टीम बनके, unit बनके समान सोच के साथ, योजनाबद्ध तरीक़े से आगे बढ़ें, तो परीक्षा सरल हो जाती है।\nश्रीमान केशव वैष्णव ने मुझे App पर लिखा है, उन्होंने शिकायत की है कि parents ने अपने बच्चों पर अधिक marks मांगने के लिए कभी भी दबाव नहीं बनाना चाहिये। सिर्फ़ तैयारी करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करना चाहिये। वो relax रहे, इसकी चिंता करनी चाहिये।\nविजय जिंदल लिखते हैं, बच्चों पर उनसे अपनी उम्मीदों का बोझ न डालें। जितना हो सके, उनका हौसला बढ़ायें। विश्वास बनाये रखने में सहायता करें। ये बात सही है। मैं आज parents को अधिक कहना नहीं चाहता हूँ। कृपा करके दबाव मत बनाइये। अगर वो अपने किसी दोस्त से बात कर रहा है, तो रोकिये मत। एक हल्का-फुल्का वातावरण बनाइए, सकारात्मक वातावरण बनाइए। देखिये, आपका बेटा हो या बेटी कितना confidence आ जायेगा। आपको भी वो confidence नज़र आयेगा।\nदोस्तो, एक बात निश्चित है, ख़ास करके मैं युवा मित्रों से कहना चाहता हूँ | हम लोगों का जीवन, हमारी पुरानी पीढ़ियों से बहुत बदल चुका है। हर पल नया innovation, नई टेक्नोलॉजी, विज्ञान के नित नए रंग-रूप देखने को मिल रहे हैं और हम सिर्फ अभिभूत हो रहे हैं, ऐसा नहीं है। हम उससे जुड़ने का पसंद करते हैं। हम भी विज्ञान की रफ़्तार से आगे बढ़ना चाहते हैं।\nमैं ये बात इसलिए कर रहा हूँ, दोस्तो कि आज National Science Day है। National Science Day, देश का विज्ञान महोत्सव हर वर्ष 28 फरवरी हम इस रूप में मनाते हैं। 28 फरवरी, 1928 सर सी.वी. रमन ने अपनी खोज ‘रमन इफ़ेक्ट’ की घोषणा की थी। यही तो खोज थी, जिसमें उनको नोबेल पुरस्कार प्राप्त हुआ और इसलिए देश 28 फरवरी को National Science Day के रूप में मनाता है। जिज्ञासा विज्ञान की जननी है। हर मन में वैज्ञानिक सोच हो, विज्ञान के प्रति आकर्षण हो और हर पीढ़ी को innovation पर बल देना होता है और विज्ञान और टेक्नोलॉजी के बिना innovation संभव नहीं होते हैं। आज National Science Day पर देश में innovation पर बल मिले। ज्ञान, विज्ञान, टेक्नोलॉजी ये सारी बातें हमारी विकास यात्रा के सहज हिस्से बनने चाहिए और इस बार National Science Day का theme है ‘Make in India Science and Technology Driven innovations’. सर सी.वी. रमन को मैं नमन करता हूँ और आप सबको विज्ञान के प्रति रुचि बढ़ाने के लिए आग्रह कर रहा हूँ।\nदोस्तो, कभी-कभी सफलताएँ बहुत देर से मिलती हैं और सफलता जब मिलती है, तब दुनिया को देखने का नज़रिया भी बदल जाता है। आप exam में शायद बहुत busy रहे होंगे, तो शायद हो सकता है, बहुत सी ख़बरे आपके मन में register न हुई हों। लेकिन मैं देशवासियो को भी इस बात को दोहराना चाहता हूँ। आपने पिछले दिनों में सुना होगा कि विज्ञान के विश्व में एक बहुत बड़ी और महत्वपूर्ण ख़ोज हुई है। विश्व के वैज्ञानिकों ने परिश्रम किया, पीढ़ियाँ आती गईं, कुछ-न-कुछ करती गईं और क़रीब-क़रीब 100 साल के बाद एक सफलता हाथ लगी। ‘Gravitational Waves’ हमारे वैज्ञानिको के पुरुषार्थ से, उसे उजागर किया गया, detect किया गया। ये विज्ञान की बहुत दूरगामी सफलता है। ये खोज न केवल पिछली सदी के हमारे महान वैज्ञानिक आइन्स्टाइन की theory को प्रमाणित करती है, बल्कि Physics के लिए महान discovery मानी जाती है। ये पूरी मानव-जाति को पूरे विश्व के काम आने वाली बात है, लेकिन एक भारतीय के नाते हम सब को इस बात की खुशी है कि सारी खोज की प्रक्रिया में हमारे देश के सपूत, हमारे देश के होनहार वैज्ञानिक भी उससे जुड़े हुये थे। उनका भी योगदान है। मैं उन सभी वैज्ञानिकों को आज ह्रदय से बधाई देना चाहता हूँ, अभिनन्दन करना चाहता हूँ। भविष्य में भी इस ख़ोज को आगे बढ़ाने में हमारे वैज्ञानिक प्रयासरत रहेंगे। अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय प्रयासों में भारत भी हिस्सेदार बनेगा और मेरे देशवासियो, पिछले दिनों में एक महत्वपूर्ण निर्णय किया है। इसी खोज में और अधिक सफ़लता पाने के लिए Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, short में उसको कहते हैं ‘LIGO’, भारत में खोलने का सरकार ने निर्णय लिया है। दुनिया में दो स्थान पर इस प्रकार की व्यवस्था है, भारत तीसरा है। भारत के जुड़ने से इस प्रक्रिया को और नई ताक़त मिलेगी, और नई गति मिलेगी। भारत ज़रूर अपने मर्यादित संसाधनों के बीच भी मानव कल्याण की इस महत्तम वैज्ञानिक ख़ोज की प्रक्रिया में सक्रिय भागीदार बनेगा। मैं फिर एक बार सभी वैज्ञानिकों को बधाई देता हूँ, शुभकामनायें देता हूँ।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैं एक नंबर लिखवाता हूँ आपको, कल से आप missed call करके इस नंबर से मेरी ‘मन की बात’ सुन सकते हैं, आपकी अपनी मातृभाषा में भी सुन सकते हैं। missed call करने के लिए नंबर है – 81908-81908. मैं दोबारा कहता हूँ 81908-81908.\nदोस्तो, आपकी exam शुरू हो रही है। मुझे भी कल exam देनी है। सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासी मेरी examination लेने वाले हैं। पता है न, अरे भई, कल बजट है! 29 फरवरी, ये Leap Year होता है। लेकिन हाँ, आपने देखा होगा, मुझे सुनते ही लगा होगा, मैं कितना स्वस्थ हूँ, कितना आत्मविश्वास से भरा हुआ हूँ। बस, कल मेरी exam हो जाये, परसों आपकी शुरू हो जाये। और हम सब सफल हों, तो देश भी सफल होगा।\nतो दोस्तो, आपको भी बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें, ढेर सारी शुभकामनायें। सफलता-विफलता के तनाव से मुक्त हो करके, मुक्त मन से आगे बढ़िये, डटे रहिये। धन्यवाद!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

        "article": "\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ,\nનમસ્કાર, તમે રેડિયો પર મારી ‘મનની વાત’ સાંભળતા હશો. પરંતુ મગજમાં ચાલતું હશે, બાળકોની પરીક્ષા શરૂ થઇ રહી છે, કેટલાકની દસમા-બારમાની પરીક્ષા કદાચ પહેલી માર્ચથી શરૂ થઇ રહી છે. તો તમારા મગજમાં પણ આ જ ચાલતું હશે. હું પણ તમારી આ યાત્રામાં તમારી સાથે જોડાવા ઇચ્છું છું. તમને તમારા બાળકોની પરીક્ષાની જેટલી ચિંતા છે તેટલી જ ચિંતા મને પણ છે. પરંતુ જો આપણે પરીક્ષાને જોવાની આપણી રીત-રસમ બદલીએ તો કદાચ આપણે ચિંતામુક્ત પણ થઇ શકીએ.\nમારી પાછલી ‘મનની વાત’માં મેં કહેલું કે તમે નરેન્દ્ર મોદી એપ પર તમારો અનુભવ, તમારા સૂચનો મને જરૂર મોકલો મને એ વાતનો આનંદ છે. શિક્ષકોએ, જેમની કારકિર્દી ખૂબ સફળ રહી છે તેવા વિદ્યાર્થીઓએ માતાપિતાએ, સમાજના કેટલાંક ચિંતકોએ ઘણીબધી વાતો મને લખીને મોકલી છે. બે વાતો તો મને સ્પર્શી ગઇ કે બધાં એ વિષયને બરાબર પકડ્યો છે. બીજી વાત, એટલી બધી હજારો યાત્રામાં ચીજો આવી કે હું માનું છું કે, કદાચ આ ખૂબ મહત્વપૂર્ણ વિષય છે. પરંતુ ઘણું ખરૂં આપણે પરીક્ષાના વિષયને શાળાના પરિસર સુધી છે. પરિવાર સુધી કે વિદ્યાર્થી સુધી સીમિત કરી દીધો છે. મારી એપ પર જે સૂચનો આવ્યા એનાથી તો લાગે છે કે, આ તો ખૂબ જ મહત્વનો વિષય છે. પૂરા રાષ્ટ્રમાં વિદ્યાર્થીઓના આ વિષયોની ચર્ચા સતત ચાલતી રહેવી જોઇએ.\nઆજે હું મારી આ ‘મનની વાત’માં વિશેષ રૂપે માતા-પિતા સાથે, પરીક્ષાર્થીઓની સાથે અને તેમના શિક્ષકોની સાથે વાતો કરવા ઇચ્છું છું. જે સાંભળ્યું છે, જે મેં વાંચ્યું છે, જે મને જણાવાયું છે, એમાંથી પણ કેટલીક વાતો કરીશ. મને જે લાગે છે એમાંથી પણ કેટલુંક ઉમેરીશ. પરંતુ મને વિશ્વાસ છે કે, જે વિદ્યાર્થીઓને પરીક્ષા આપવાની છે એમના માટે મારી આ 25-30 મિનીટ ઘણી ઉપયોગ થશે, એવું મારૂં માનવું છે.\nમારા વ્હાલા વિદ્યાર્થી મિત્રો, હું કંઇ કહું એ પહેલાં આજની ‘મનની વાત’નો ઉઘાડ આપણે વિશ્વના વેલ-નોન ઓપનરની સાથે કેમ ન કરીએ. જીવનમાં સફળતાના શિખરો સર કરવા માટે કઇ ચીજો એમને કામ લાગી, એમનો અનુભવ તમને જરૂર કામ લાગશે. ભારતના યુવાનોને જેના પ્રતિ ગૌરવ છે એવા ભારતરત્ન શ્રીમાન સચિન તેંડુલકર – એમણે જે સંદેશો મોકલ્યો છે, એ હું તમને સંભળાવવા ઇચ્છું છું…\n“નમસ્કાર, હું સચિન તેડુંલકર બોલી રહ્યો છું, મને ખબર છે કે પરીક્ષા કેટલાક દિવસોમાં શરૂ થવાની છે. તમારામાંથી કેટલાક લોકો તણાવમાં રહેશો. મારો એક જ સંદેશ છે આપને, તમારાથી ઘણી અપેક્ષાઓ તમારા માતા-પિતા રાખશે, તમારા શિક્ષકો રાખશે. તમારા બીજા કુટુંબના સભ્યો રાખશે. મિત્રો રાખશે. જ્યાં પણ જશો, સૌ પૂછશે કે તમારી તૈયારીઓ કેવી ચાલી રહી છે. કેટલા ટકા તમે સ્કોર કરશો. એજ કહેવા ઈચ્છીશ હું કે તમે ખુદ પોતાના માટે એક લક્ષ્ય નક્કી કરજો, બીજાની અપેક્ષાઓના દબાણમાં ન આવતા. તમે મહેનત જરૂર કરજો, પણ એક વાસ્તવિક મેળવેલું લક્ષ્ય પોતાના માટે નક્કી કરો અને તે લક્ષ્યને મેળવવા માટે પ્રયત્ન કરજો. હું જ્યારે ક્રિકેટ રમતો હતો, તો મારાથી પણ ઘણી અપેક્ષાઓ રહેતી હતી. પાછલા 24 વર્ષમાં કેટલીય મુશ્કેલ ક્ષણો આવી અને ક્યારેક ક્યારેક ઘણી સારી ક્ષણો આવી, પરંતુ લોકોની અપેક્ષાઓ હંમેશા રહેતી હતી અને એ વધતી જ ગઈ, જેમ સમય પસાર થતો ગયો, અપેક્ષાઓ વધતી જ ગઈ. તો આના માટે મારે એક હલ શોધવો ખૂબ જરૂરી હતો. તો મેં વિચાર્યું કે હું ખૂદ અપેક્ષા રાખીશ અને પોતાના લક્ષ્યને પૂર્ણ કરીશ. પરંતુ એ મારા ખુદના લક્ષ્યને પૂર્ણ કરી રહ્યો છું અને તે પૂર્ણ કરી રહ્યો છું, તો હું જરૂર કંઈકને કંઈક સારી વસ્તુ દેશ માટે કરી રહ્યો છું. અને એ જ લક્ષ્ય હું હંમેશા મેળવવાનો પ્રયત્નો કરતો હતો. મારું ફોકસ રહેતું હતું બોલ પર અને લક્ષ્ય પોતાની મેળે ધીરે ધીરે હાંસલ થતાં ગયા. હું આપને એ જ કહીશ કે તમે, તમારા વિચારો હકારાત્મક હોવા ખૂબ જરૂરી છે. હકારાત્મક વિચારોને હકારાત્મક પરિણામ અનુસરશે. તો તમે હકારાત્મક જરૂર રહેજો અને ઉપરવાળો તમને જરૂરથી સારું પરિણામ આપે તેની મને પૂરી ખાતરી છે અને હું આપને પરીક્ષા માટે શુભેચ્છા પાઠવું છું. તણાવ રહિત જઈને પેપર લખો અને સારું પરિણામ મેળવો. ગુડલક.”\nદોસ્તો, જોયું તેંડુલકરજી શું કહી રહ્યાં છે. આ અપેક્ષાઓના ભાર નીચે દબાઇ જવાનું નથી. તમારૂં ભવિષ્ય તમારે જ ઘડવાનું છે. તમે તમારી જાતે તમારૂં લક્ષ્ય નક્કી કરો. તમે જાતે જ તમારા ટારગેટ નક્કી કરો. – મુક્ત મનથી, મુક્ત વિચારથી, મુક્ત સામર્થ્યથી. મને વિશ્વાસ છે કે, સચિનજીની આ વાત તમને કામ લાગશે. અને આ વાત સાચી છે. પ્રતિસ્પર્ધા કેમ ? અનુસ્પર્ધા કેમ નહીં ? આપણે બીજા સાથે સ્પર્ધા કરવામાં પોતાનો સમય શા માટે બરબાદ કરીએ. આપણે જાત સાથે જ સ્પર્ધા કેમ ન કરીએ. આપણાં જ જૂના બધાં રેકોર્ડઝ તોડવાનું આપણે નક્કી કેમ ન કરીએ. તમે જૂઓ, તમને આગળ વધતાં કોઇ રોકી શકશે નહીં. અને તમારાં જ જૂના રેકોર્ડઝને જયારે તોડશો, ત્યારે તમને આનંદ માટે, સંતોષ માટે, કોઇની પાસે અપેક્ષા પણ નહીં રહે, ભીતરથી એક સંતોષ પ્રગટ થશે.\nદોસ્તો પરીક્ષાને આંકડાઓની રમત ન માનો. કયાં પહોંચ્યા, કેટલે પહોંચ્યા એના હિસાબ-કિતાબમાં ફસાયેલાં ન રહો. જીવનને તો કોઇ મહાન ઉદ્દેશ સાથે જોડવું જોઇએ. સ્વપ્નોને લઇને ચાલવું જોઇએ. સંકલ્પબદ્ધ થવું જોઇએ. આ પરીક્ષાઓ તો આપણે સાચા જઇ રહ્યા છીએ કે નહીં તેનો હિસાબકિતાબ કરે છે, આપણી ગતિ બરાબર છે કે નહીં તેનો હિસાબ-કિતાબ કરે છે. અને એટલા માટે સપના જો વિશાળ, વિરાટ રહેશે તો પરીક્ષા એની મેળે જ એક આનંદોત્સવ બની જશે. દરેક પરીક્ષા આ મહાન ઉદ્દેશને પરિપૂર્ણ કરવા માટેનું એક પગલું હશે. દરેક સફળતા એ મહાન ઉદ્દેશને પામવાની ચાવી બની જશે. અને આ માટે આ વર્ષે શું થશે, આવી પરીક્ષામાં શું થશે, તેમાં સીમિત ન રહો. એક ખૂબ મોટા ઉદ્દેશને લઇને ચાલો અને એમાં કયારેક અપેક્ષાથી ઓછું પણ કશું રહી જાય તો નિરાશા નહીં આવે. અને વધારે તાકાતથી પ્રયત્નો કરવાની હિંમત આવશે.\nહજારો લોકોએ મને મારી એપ પર મોબાઇલ ફોનથી નાનીનાની વાતો લખી છે. શ્રેય ગુપ્તાએ એ વાત પર ભાર મૂક્યો છે કે, સ્વસ્થ શરીરમાં જ સ્વસ્થ મન રહે છે. વિદ્યાર્થીઓ, તમારા અભ્યાસ સાથેસાથે તમારા સ્વાસ્થ્યનું પણ ધ્યાન રાખો. જેથી તમે પરીક્ષામાં સ્વસ્થાપૂર્વક સારી રીતે લખી શકો. હવે હું આજે છેલ્લા દિવસે એમ તો નહીં જ કહું કે તમે દંડબેઠક કરવાનું શરૂ કરી દો. અને ત્રણ કિલોમીટર, પાંચ કિલોમીટર દોડવા માટે જાવ. પરંતુ એક વાત સાચી છે કે ખાસ કરીને પરીક્ષાના દિવસોમાં તમારી દિન-ચર્યા કેવી છે. આપણા 365 દિવસ આપણી દિનચર્યા આપણાં સ્વપ્નો અને સંકલ્પોને અનૂરૂપ હોવી જોઇએ. શ્રીમાન પ્રભાકર રેડ્ડીજીની એક વાત સાથે હું સંમત છું, એમણે ખાસ આગ્રહ કર્યો છે કે, સમયસર સૂવું જોઇએ. અને સવારે વ્હેલાં ઉઠીને રીવીઝન કરવું જોઇએ. પરીક્ષાકેન્દ્ર પર પ્રવેશપત્ર અને બીજી વસ્તુઓ લઇને સમય કરતાં પહેલાં પહોંચી જવું જોઇએ. આ વાત પ્રભાકર રેડ્ડીજીએ કરી છે, હું કદાચ કહેવાની હિંમત ન કરૂં, કારણ કે, સુવા બાબતે હું થોડો ઉદાસીન છું. અને મારા ઘણા મિત્રો પણ મને ફરિયાદ કરતાં રહે છે કે તમે ખૂબ ઓછું સૂવો છો. આ મારી એક મર્યાદા છે. હું પણ એમાંથી બહાર આવવાનો પ્રયત્ન કરીશ. પરંતુ હું એ સાથે સંમત જરૂર છું. સૂવાનો નિર્ધારિત સમય, ઊંડી ઊંઘ – એ એટલી જ મહત્વની છે, જેટલી તમારી દિવસભરની કામગીરી. અને આ શક્ય છે. હું નસીબદાર છું, મારી ઊંઘ ઓછી છે પણ ખૂબ ઊંડી ચોક્કસ છે અને આથી મારૂં કામ ચાલી પણ જાય છે. પરંતુ તમને તો હું આગ્રહ કરીશ. નહીંતર કેટલાંક લોકોને સુતાં પહેલાં ટેલિફોન પર લાંબી લાંબી વાતો કરવાની ટેવ હોય છે, અને એ પછી એ જ વિચાર ચાલતાં રહે છે, તો પછી ઊંઘ કયાંથી આવશે. અને જયારે હું સુવાની વાત કરૂં છું, તો એવું વિચારશો નહીં કે હું પરીક્ષા સમયે, સુવા માટે કહી રહ્યો છું. ગેરસમજ કરશો નહીં, હું પરીક્ષાના સમયે તો પરીક્ષા સારી રીતે આપવા માટે, તનાવ-મુક્ત અવસ્થા માટે તમને સુવાની વાત કરી રહ્યો છું., સુતા રહેવાની વાત નથી કરી રહ્યો. નહિંતર કયાંક એવું ન થાય કે માર્કસ ઓછા આવે અને મા પૂછે કે, બેટા, માર્કસ કેમ ઓછા આવ્યા તો કહી દો કે, મોદીજીએ સુવા માટે કહ્યું હતું એટલે હું તો સૂઇ ગયો હતો. આવું નહીં કરોને ! મને વિશ્વાસ છે કે નહીં કરો !\nજીવનમાં શિસ્ત સફળતાઓની આધારશીલાને મજબૂત કરવાનું બહુ મોટું કારણ હોય છે. શિસ્તથી એ મજબૂત પાયો રચાય છે. અને જે અવ્યવસ્થિત હોય છે, શિસ્તબદ્ધ હોતાં નથી, સવારનું કામ સાંજે કરે છે, બપોરનું કામ મોડી રાત્રે કરે છે, એમને એવું તો લાગે છે કે, કામ થઇ ગયું, પરંતુ તેમની શકિતનો દૂર-વ્યય થાય છે. અને દરેક પળે તનાવ રહે છે. આપણા શરીરમાં પણ એકાદ અંગ, આપણા શરીરના એકાદ ભાગમાં પણ થોડીક તકલીફ થાય તો તમે જોયું હશે કે આખું શરીર સહજતાનો અનુભવ નથી કરતું. એટલું જ નહીં, આપણી દિન-ચર્યા પણ અસ્તવ્યસ્ત થઇ જાય છે. અને એટલા માટે કોઇ ચીજને આપણે નાની ન માનીએ. તમે જૂઓ, જે નિશ્ચિત છે એની સાથે સમજૂતિ કરવાની ટેવમાં તમારી જાત ફસાય નહી. નક્કી કરો, કરીને જુઓ.\nદોસ્તો, કયારેક કયારેક મેં જોયું છે કે, જે વિદ્યાર્થીઓ પરીક્ષા માટે જાય છે, એમાં બે પ્રકારના વિદ્યાર્થીઓ હોય છે. એક, એણે શું વાંચ્યું છે, શું શીખ્યા છે, કઇ બાબતોમાં એની શકિત સારી છે. એ બાબતો પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રિત કરે છે. બીજા પ્રકારના વિદ્યાર્થીઓ હોય છે, યાર, ખબર નથી, કયા સવાલ આવશે, ખબર નહીં કેવા સવાલ આવશે, ખબર નહીં, પેપર અઘરૂં હશે કે સહેલું ? આ બે પ્રકારના વિદ્યાર્થીઓ તમે જોયા હશે. જેઓ કેવું પેપર આવશે તેની ચિંતામાં રહે છે એનો એમના પરિણામ પર નકારાત્મક પ્રભાવ પડે છે. જેઓ આત્મવિશ્વાસથી જાય છે. તેઓ, કંઇપણ આવે તો તેઓ પાર ઉતરે છે. આ વાતને મારાથી પણ સારી રીતે જો કોઇ કરી શકે તો, ચેકમેટ કરવામાં જેની માસ્ટરી છે અને દુનિયાના મોટા મોટા ખેલાડીઓને જેમણે ચેકમેટ કરી દીધા છે. તેવા ચેસના ચેમ્પીયન વિશ્વનાથન આનંદ એમના અનુભવ કહેશે. આવો, આ પરીક્ષામાં તમે ચેકમેટ કરવાની રીત એમની પાસેથી શીખી લો.\n‘‘ હેલો, હું વિશ્વનાથન આનંદ, સૌપ્રથમ તમારી પરીક્ષા મટે શુભેચ્છાઓ પાઠવીને મારી વાતનો પ્રારંભ કરૂં. મેં આપેલી પરીક્ષાઓ અને એના અનુભવો વિશે હું થોડીક વાત કરીશ. પરીક્ષાઓ ને પછીથી જીવનમાં આવનાર સમસ્યાઓ જેવી લાગી છે. તમારે જરૂર છે પૂરતા આરામની, ગાઢ નિંદ્રાની, પૂરા ખોરાકની, અને સૌથી મહત્વની વસ્તુ તે મનની શાંતિ. આ બધુ ચેસની રમત સાથે ઘણું સામ્ય ધરાવે છે. જયારે તમે રમો છો ત્યારે તમે જાણતા નથી કે હવે ક્યું પ્યાદું આવશે, જેમ વર્ગમાં પણ તમે જાણતાં નથી કે પરીક્ષામાં કયો પ્રશ્ન પૂછાશે. જે તમે શાંત હો, સ્વસ્થ હો, અને પૂરતી નિંદ્રા લીધી હોય તો તમને સાચો જવાબ જે તે પળે મગજ આપશે. આથી શાંત રહો. તમારી જાત પર વધારે દબાણ ન આપો, વધારે પડતી અપેક્ષાઓ ન રાખો, એ ખૂબ મહત્વનું છે. તેને એક પડકારરૂપે જુઓ – વર્ષ દરમિયાન મને જે ભણાવાયું છે તે મને યાદ છે, હું સમસ્યાઓ ઉકેલી શકું છું. છેલ્લી મિનિટોમાં જે વિષયો તમને બરાબર યાદ ન હોય એવું લાગતું હોય, એમાંથી મહત્વની બાબતોમાંથી પસાર થાવ. કેટલીક વિગતો તમે શિક્ષક અથવા વિદ્યાર્થીઓ સાથે યાદ કરી શકો. જે તમને પરીક્ષામાં લખતી વેળાએ મદદરૂપ થશે. તમને મુશ્કેલ લાગતાં પ્રશ્નોનું તમે પુનરાવર્તન કરશો તો તે બધું તમારા મગજમાં તાજું હશે, અને પરીક્ષામાં તે વિશે તમે વધારે સારી રીતે લખી શકશો. આથી શાંત રહો, પૂરતી ગાઢ નિંદ્રા લો, અતિ વિશ્વાસમાં ન રાચો, અને જરીકે હતાશ ન થાવ, શરૂઆતમાં ભય લાગે પરંતુ આ પરીક્ષાઓ હું સફળતાપૂર્વક પાર કરી શક્યો છું. આથી જાતમાં પૂરો વિશ્વાસ રાખો. અને પરીક્ષાઓ માટે શુભેચ્છાઓ.’’\nવિશ્વનાથન આનંદે ખરેખર ખૂબ જ મહત્વપૂર્ણ વાત કરી છે. અને તમે પણ જયારે એમને આંતરરાષ્ટ્રીય ચેસ રમતાં જોયાં હશે. કેટલી સ્વસ્થતાથી તેઓ બેઠેલા હોય છે, અને કેટલા ધ્યાનસ્થ હોય છે. એમની નજર પણ આમતેમ જતી નથી. કયારેક આપણે સાંભળતાં હતા ને, અર્જૂનના જીવનની ઘટના – એમની નજર કેવી પક્ષીની આંખ પર રહેતી હતી. બરાબર એમજ, વિશ્વનાથનને રમતાં જોઇએ છીએ ત્યારે એમની આંખો એકદમ, બિલકુલ ટાર્ગેટ પર રહે છે. અને એ અંદરની શાંતિની અભિવ્યકિત હોય છે. એ વાત સાચી છે કે કોઇના કહેવાથી અંદરની શાંતિ આવી જ જશે એ કહેવું મુશ્કેલ છે. પરંતુ પ્રયત્ન કરવો જોઇએ. હસતા હસતા કેમ ન કરીએ ? તમે જુઓ, હસતા રહેશો, પરીક્ષાના દિવસે પણ શાંતિ એને મેળે આવવા લાગશે. તમે મિત્રો સાથે વાત નથી કરી રહ્યાં અથવા એકલા ચાલી રહ્યાં છો. ઉદાસ ઉદાસ ચાલી રહ્યાં છો., ઢગલો પુસ્તકોને છેલ્લી ક્ષણોમાં ઉથલાવી રહ્યાં છો, તો, તો પછી તમારૂં મન શાંત નહીં થઇ શકે. હસો, ખૂબ હસતા ચાલો, મિત્રો સાથે જોક્સ કહેતાં ચાલો, તમે જુઓ, એની મેળે જ શાંતિનો માહોલ રચાઇ જશે. હું તમને એક નાની વાત સમજાવવા ઇચ્છું છું. તમે કલ્પાના કરો કે, એક તળાવ કાંઠે તમે ઉભા છો, અને તળાવમાં નીચે ખૂબ સુંદર ચીજો દેખાય છે. પરંતુ અચાનક કોઇ પાણીમાં પથ્થર ફેંકે અને પાણીમાં વમળ શરૂ થઇ જાય તો, તળાવમાં જે સુંદર ચીજો દેખાતી હતી તે શું દેખાશે ? જો પાણી શાંત હોય તો ચીજો ગમે તેટલી ઊંડે ભલે ન હોય, તે દેખાય છે. પરંતુ જો પાણી અશાંત હોય તો નીચે કંઇ જ દેખાતું નથી. તમારી અંદર પણ ઘણું બધું પડેલું છે. વર્ષભરની મહેનતનો ભંડાર ભરેલો પડ્યો છે. પરંતુ જો મન અશાંત હશે તો એ ખજાનો તમે જ શોધી નહીં શકો. અગર મન શાંત રહ્યું તો તમારો એ ખજાનો ઉભરાઇને તમારી સામે આવશે. અને તમારી પરીક્ષા એકદમ સરળ બની જશે.\nહું મારી એક વાત જણાવું, હું કયારેક કયારેક કોઇ ભાષણ સાંભળવા જાઉં છું. અથવા તો સરકારમાં પણ કેટલાક વિષય એવા હોય છે જે હું જાણતો નથી. અને મારે ખૂબ એકાગ્ર થવું પડે છે. તો કયારેક કયારેક અત્યંત એકાગ્ર થઇને સમજવાનો પ્રયત્ન કરૂં છું તો અંદર એક તણાવ અનુભવાય છે. પછી મને લાગે છે, ના – ના થોડો હળવો થઇ જાઉં તો મને સારૂં લાગશે. તો મેં મારી જાતે જ મારી ટેકનિક વિકસાવી છે. થોડીવાર ઊંડા શ્વાસ લઇ લઉં છું. ત્રણવાર, પાંચવાર ઊંડા શ્વાસ લઉં છું. સમય તો ત્રીસ સેકન્ડ, ચાલીસ સેકન્ડ, પચાસ સેકન્ડ જાય છે. પરંતુ પછી મારૂં મન એકદમ શાંત થઇને ચીજોને સમજવા માટે તૈયાર થઇ જાય છે. શકય છે, આ મારો અનુભવ હોય, જે તમને પણ કામ આવી જશે.\nરજત અગ્રવાલે એક સરસ વાત જણાવી છે. તેઓ મારી એપ પર લખે છે – આપણે રોજ ઓછામાં ઓછો અડધો કલાક મિત્રો સાથે, પરિવારજનો સાથે હળવાશ અનુભવીએ, ગપ્પા મારીએ આ ખૂબ મહત્વપૂર્ણ વાત રજતજીએ જણાવી છે, કારણ કે મોટેભાગે આપણે જોઇએ છીએ કે, આપણે જયારે પરીક્ષા આપીને આવીએ છીએ ત્યારે ગણવા માટે બેસી જઇએ છીએ કે કેટલું સાચું કર્યું કેટલું ખોટું. અગર ઘરમાં માતાપિતા પણ જો ભણેલા હોય, અને એમાંય જો માતાપિતા પણ શિક્ષક હોય તો તો પછી પૂરેપૂરૂં પેપર લખાવે છે. – બતાવો તમે શું લખ્યું, શું થયું ? સરવાળો કરતાં જાય છે. જુઓ, તમને ચાલીશ આવશે કે એંશી કે નેવું ! જે પરીક્ષા પતી ગઇ એમાં જ તમારૂં મગજ રચ્યું પચ્યું રહે છે. તમે પણ શું કરો છો, મિત્રો સાથે ફોન પર વાત કરો છો અરે, યાર આમાં તે શું લખ્યું ! અરે આમાં તારૂં કેવું ગયું ! સારૂં, તને શું લાગ્યું. યાર, મારે તો ગરબડ થઇ ગઇ. યાર, મેં તો ખોટું કરી દીધું. અરે, યાર મને તો આવડતું હતું પણ યાદ જ ન આવ્યું. આપણે એમાં જ ફસાઇ જઇએ છીએ. દોસ્તો, આવું ન કરો. પરીક્ષાના સમયે જે થઇ ગયું તે થઇ ગયું. પરિવારની સાથે અન્ય વિષયો પર ગપ્પા મારો, જૂની મજાક મસ્તીની વાતો યાદ કરો, કયારેક માતાપિતા સાથે કયાંક ગયા હોવ તો ત્યાંના દ્રશ્યોને યાદ કરો. એમાંથી બરાબર બહાર આવીને અડધો કલાક વિતાવો. રજતજીની વાત ખરેખર સમજવા જેવી છે.\nમિત્રો, હું શું તમને શાંતિની વાત જણાવું ? આજે તમને પરીક્ષા આપતા પહેલાં એક એવી વ્યકિતએ તમારા માટે સંદેશો મોકલ્યો છે, તેઓ મૂળભૂત શિક્ષક છે ને આજ એક રીતે સંસ્કારશિક્ષક બનેલા છે. રામચરિતમાનસ, વર્તમાન સંદર્ભમાં તેની વ્યાખ્યા કરતાં કરતાં તેઓ દેશ અને દુનિયાના આ સંસ્કાર સરિતાને પહોંચાડવાનો પ્રયત્ન કરી રહ્યાં છે. એવાં પૂજય મૂરારિબાપુએ પણ વિદ્યાર્થીઓ માટે ઘણી મહત્વપૂર્ણ ટીપ મોકલી છે. અને તેઓ તો શિક્ષક પણ છે, ચિંતક પણ છે અને એટલે એમની વાતોમાં બન્નનો સુમેળ છે.\n“હું મુરારી બાપૂ બોલી રહ્યો છું. હું વિદ્યાર્થી ભાઈઓ-બહેનોને એ જ કહેવા માંગું છું કે પરિક્ષાના સમયે મન પર કોઈ પણ ભાર રાખ્યા વિના અને બુદ્ધિનો એક સ્પષ્ટ નિર્ણય કરીને તથા ચિત્ત એકાગ્ર કરીને આપ પરીક્ષામાં બેસો અને જે સ્થિતિ આવી છે, તેનો સ્વીકાર કરી લો. મારો અનુભવ છે કે પરિસ્થિતિનો સ્વીકાર કરવાથી આપણે ખૂબ પ્રસન્ન રહી શકીએ છીએ અને ખુશ રહી શકીએ છીએ. તમારી પરીક્ષામાં તમે ભાર વિના અને પ્રસન્ન ચિત્તથી આગળ વધો તો જરૂર સફળતા મળશે અને જો સફળતા ન પણ મળે તો પણ નાપાસ થવાની ગ્લાની નહીં થાય અને સફળ થવાનો ગર્વ પણ થશે. એક શેર કહીને હું મારો સંદેશ અને શુભકામના પાઠવું – લાજિમ નહીં કિ હર કોઈ હો કામયાબ હી, જીના ભી સિખિએ નાકામિયો કે સાથ. આપણા આદરણીય પ્રધાનમંત્રીનો જે આ ‘મન કી બાત’નો કાર્યક્રમ છે, તેને હું ખૂબ આવકાર આપું છું. સૌને મારી ખૂબ ખૂબ શુભકામનાઓ, ધન્યવાદ.”\nપૂજયશ્રી મુરારીબાપુનો હું પણ આભારી છું કે, એમણે આપણે ખૂબ સારો સંદેશ આપ્યો. દોસ્તો, આજે એક અન્ય વાત પણ જણાવવા ઇચ્છું છું. હું જોઇ રહ્યો છું કે, આ વખતે જે લોકોએ મને તેમના અનુભવો જણાવ્યા છે એમાં યોગની ચર્ચા અવશ્ય કરી છે. અને આ મારા માટે આનંદની વાત છે કે, આ દિવસોમાં દુનિયામાં જેને પણ મળું છું, તે થોડોક સમય પણ મળે ત્યારે યોગની થોડીક વાત તો કોઇને કોઇ કરે જ છે, દુનિયાના કોઇપણ દેસનો વ્યકિત કેમ ન હોય, ભારતનો કોઇ વ્યકિત કેમ ન હોય, મને તો સારૂં લાગે છે કે યોગ બાબતે આટલું આકર્ષણ ઉત્પન્ન થયું છે, આટલી જિજ્ઞાસા ઉત્પન્ન થઇ છે અને જુઓ, મારા મોબાઇલ એપ પર શ્રી અતનું મંડલ, શ્રી કુણાલ ગુપ્તા, શ્રી સુશાંતકુમાર, શ્રી કે.જી.આનંદ, શ્રી અભિજીત કુલકર્ણી, ન જાણે અગણિત લોકોએ ધ્યાનની વાત કરી છે. યોગ પર ભાર મૂક્યો છે. ખેર, મિત્રો, હું આજે જ સ્પષ્ટ કરી દઉં, કાલ સવારથી જ યોગ કરવો શરૂ કરવો તો એ તમારી સાથે અન્યાય થશે. પરંતુ જેઓ યોગ કરે છે તેઓ પરીક્ષા છે માટે આજે ન કરે, એવું ન કરતા, કરો છો, તો કરો. પરંતુ આ વાત સાચી છે કે વિદ્યાર્થીજીવનમાં હોય કે જીવનના ઉત્તરાર્ધમાં હોય, અંતરમનની વિકાસયાત્રામાં યોગ એક મોટી ચાવી છે. સરળમાં સરળ ચાવી છે. તમે જરૂર તેના પર ધ્યાન આપો. હા, તમારી નજીકમાં કોઇ યોગના જાણકાર હોય, અને એમને પૂછશો તો પરીક્ષાના દિવસો પહેલાં યોગ ન કર્યો હોય, તો પણ બે-ચાર ચીજો તો એવી બતાવી જ દેશે, જે તમે બે-ચાર મીનીટમાં કરી શકો. જુઓ, અગર તમે કરી શકો તો. મારો એમાં ખૂબ વિશ્વાસ છે.\nમારા નવજુવાન સાથીઓ, પરીક્ષા હોલમાં જવાની તમને ખૂબ ઉતાવળ હોય છે, જલ્દી જલ્દી તમારી બેન્ચ પર બેસી જવાનું મન થાય છે. આ બધું ઉતાવળમાં શા માટે કરીએ ? તમારા આખા દિવસના સમયનું એવું આયોજન કેમ ન કરીએ કે, કયાંક ટ્રાફિકમાં રોકાવું પડે તો પણ સમય પર આપણે પહોંચી જઇએ. નહિંતર આવી બાબતો એક નવો તણાવ પેદા કરે છે. અન્ય એક વાત છે, આપણને જેટલો સમય મળ્યો છે એમાં જે પ્રશ્નપત્ર છે, જે સૂચનો છે. તે આપણને કયારેક કયારેક લાગે છે કે આ આપણો સમય ખાઇ જશે. એવું નથી દોસ્તો. તમે એ સૂચનાઓને ઝીણવટથી વાંચો. બે મિનિટ, – ત્રણ મિનિટ – પાંચ મિનિટ જશે. કોઇ નુકસાન નહીં થાય, પરંતુ એનાથી પરીક્ષામાં શું કરવું છે, એમાં કોઇ ગરબડ નહીં થાય. અને પાછળથી પસ્તાવો નહીં થાય. અને મેં જોયું છે કે, કયારેક કયારેક પેપર આવ્યા પછી પણ પેટર્ન નવી આવી છે તેની ખબર પડે છે. પરંતુ સૂચનાઓ વાંચી લઇએ છીએ તો કદાચ આપણે આપણને કોપઅપ કરી લઇએ છીએ કે, હા, બરાબર છે, ચાલો, મારે આમ જ જવાનું છે. અને હું તમને આગ્રહ કરીશ કે ભલે તમારી પાંચ મિનિટ આમાં જાય, પણ સૂચનાઓ જરૂર વાંચો.\nશ્રીમાન યશ નાગરે અમારી મોબાઇલ એપ પર લખ્યું છે કે, જયારે તેમણે પહેલીવાર પેપર વાંચ્યું તો તેમને ઘણું અઘરૂં લાગ્યું. પરંતુ એ પેપરને બીજીવાર આત્મવિશ્વાસ સાથે વાંચ્યું. હવે આ જ પેપર મારી પાસે છે, કોઇ નવા પ્રશ્ન આવવાના નથી, મારે આટલા જ પ્રશ્નો ઉકેલવાના છે. અને જયારે ફરી હું વિચારવા લાગ્યો તો, હું સરળતાથી એ પેપરને સમજી શક્યો. પહેલીવાર વાંચ્યું, તો લાગ્યું હતું કે, આ તો મને નથી આવડતું, પરંતુ એ જ વસ્તુ બીજીવાર વાંચી, તો મારા ધ્યાનમાં આવ્યું કે, ના – ના સવાલ બીજી રીતે પૂછાયો છે, પરંતુ આ તો મને આવડે છે એ જ વાત છે પ્રશ્નોને ન સમજવાના કારણે કયારેક કયારેક પ્રશ્નો અઘરા લાગે છે. હું યશ નાગરની આ વાત પર ભાર મૂકું છું કે, તમે પ્રશ્નોને બે-વાર વાંચો, ત્રણ વાર વાંચો. ચાર વાર વાંચો અને તમે જે જાણો છો તેની સાથે પ્રશ્નને સરખાવવાનો પ્રયત્ન કરો. તમે જુઓ, એ પ્રશ્ન લખતાં પહેલા જ સરળ થઇ જશે.\nમારે માટે આજે આનંદની વાત છે કે, ભારતરત્ન અને આપણા ખૂબ સન્માનિત વૈજ્ઞાનિક શ્રી સી.એન.આર.રાવ, એમણે ધીરજ પર ભાર મૂક્યો છે. ખૂબ જ ઓછા શબ્દોમાં પણ ખૂબ જ સરસ સંદેશ બધા વિદ્યાર્થીઓને આપ્યો છે. આવો, રાવ સાહેબનો સંદેશો સાંભળીએ.\n‘હું બેંગ્લોરથી સી.એન.આર.રાવ બોલું છું. હું સમજું છું કે પરીક્ષાના કારણે ચિંતા થાય એ સ્વાભાવિક છે. અને એમાંય આ તો સ્પર્ધાત્મક પરીક્ષાઓ. ચિંતા ન કરો, તમે સરસ કામ કરો. મારા યુવાન મિત્રોને હું આમ જ કહું છું. આ દેશમાં ઘણીબધી તકો છે એ હંમેશા યાદ રાખો. તમે જીવનમાં શું કરવા ઇચ્છો છો તે નક્કી કરો. અને તેને છોડી ન દો. તમે સફળ થશો. તમે બ્રહ્માંડનું બાળ છો તે ન ભૂલો. પહાડો તથા વૃક્ષોની જેમ તમને પણ અહીં હોવાનો અધિકાર છે. દ્રઢતા, નિષ્ઠા અને તપ તમારામાં હોવા જોઇએ. આવી ગુણવત્તા સાથે તમે દરેક પરીક્ષામાં અને અન્ય પ્રયાસોમાં સફળ થશો. તમે જે કરવા ઇચ્છો છો તે દરેક બાબતે મારી શુભેચ્છાઓ પાઠવું છું. ગોડ બ્લેસ’\nજોયું, એક વૈજ્ઞાનિકની વાત કરવાની રીત કેવી હોય છે. જે વાત કહેવામાં હું અર્ધો કલાક કરૂં છું. તે વાત તેઓ ત્રણ મિનિટમાં કહી દે છે. આ જ તો વિજ્ઞાનની તાકાત છે. અને આ જ તો વૈજ્ઞાનિક મનની તાકાત છે. દેશના બાળકોને પ્રેરણા આપી એ બદલ હું રાવ સાહેબનો આભારી છું. એમણે જે વાત કરી છે – નિષ્ઠાની, તપની, આ જ વાત છે – dedication, determination, diligence. લાગ્યા રહો. દોસ્તો લાગ્યા રહો. જો તમે લાગેલા રહેશો તો ડર પણ ડરશે. અને સારૂં કાર્ય કરવા માટે સોનેરી ભવિષ્ય તમારી પ્રતિક્ષા કરી રહ્યું છે.\nહવે મારા એપ પર રૂચિકા ડાબસે પરીક્ષાના અનુભવને લગતો એક સંદેશ આપ્યો છે. એમણે કહ્યું છે કે, એમના પરિવારમાં પરીક્ષાના સમયે સકારાત્મક વાતાવરણ બનાવવાનો લગાતાર પ્રયાસ થાય છે. અને તેની ચર્ચા તેમના સાથી પરિવારોમાં પણ થતી હતી. બધું મળીને હકારાત્મક વાતાવરણ. આ વાત સાચી છે સચિનજીએ પણ કહેલું તેમ પોઝીટીવ એપ્રોચ, પોઝીટીવ ફ્રેમ ઓફ માઇન્ડ. હકારાત્મક ઉર્જાને ઉજાગર કરે છે. કયારેક કયારેક ઘણી બધી વાતો એવી હોય છે જે આપણેને પ્રેરણા આપે છે. અને એવું ન વિચારીએ કે, આ વાતો વિદ્યાર્થીઓને જ પ્રેરણા આપે છે. જીવનના કોઇપણ પડાવ પર તમે કેમ ન હોવ. ઉત્તમ ઉદાહરણ, સત્ય ઘટનાઓ, ઘણી મોટી પ્રેરણા પણ આપે છે. ઘણીમોટી શકિત પણ આપે છે. અને સંકટના સમયે નવો રસ્તો પણ બનાવી દે છે. આપણે વીજળીના ગોળાના શોધક થોમસ એલવા એડિશન વિશે આપણા અભ્યાસક્રમમાં વાંચીએ છીએ. પરંતુ મિત્રો કયારેક એ વિચાર્યું છે, આ કામ કરવા માટે તેમને કેટલાં વર્ષો લાગ્યાં ? કેટલીવાર નિષ્ફળતા મળી, કેટલો સમય ગયો, કેટલા પૈસા ગયા, નિષ્ફળતાને કારણે કેટલી નિરાશા થઇ હશે. પરંતુ આજે એ વીજળી, એ બલ્બ આપણી જિંદગીને પણ રોશન કરે છે. આને જ તો કહે છે નિષ્ફળતામાં પણ સફળતાની સંભાવનાઓ છુપાયેલ હોય છે.\nશ્રીનિવાસ રામાનુજનને કોણ નથી ઓળખતું ? આધુનિક સમયના ગણિતજ્ઞમાંથી એક નામ – ભારતીય ગણિતજ્ઞ, તમને ખબર હશે. તેમના ઔપચારિક શિક્ષણમાં ગણિતના વિષયોનો સમાવેશ થયો નહોતો કોઇ વિશેષ પ્રશિક્ષણ પણ તેઓ પામ્યા નહોતા. પરંતુ તેમણે મેથેમેટીકલ એનાલીસીસ, નંબર થીયરી જેવા વિભિન્ન ક્ષેત્રોમાં ગહન યોગદાન આપ્યું. અત્યંત કષ્ટમય દુઃખમય જીવન હોવા છતાંય તેઓ દુનિયાને ઘણુંબધું અર્પણ કરીને ગયા.\nજે.કે.રોલિંગ એક ઉત્તમ ઉદાહરણ છે કે, સફળતા કોઇને પણ કયારેય પણ મળી શકે છે. હૈરી પોટર શ્રેણી આજે દુનિયાભરમાં લોકપ્રિય છે, પરંતુ શરૂઆતમાં આમ નહોતું. ઘણી મુશ્કેલીઓ તેમને સહન કરવી પડી હતી. ઘણી નિષ્ફળતા પણ મળી હતી. રોલિંગે કહ્યું હતું કે, મુશ્કેલીઓમાં તેઓ પૂરી ઉર્જાએ એન કામમાં લગાવતા હતાં જે ખરેખર તેમને માટે મહત્વનું હતું.\nપરીક્ષા આજકાલ માત્ર વિદ્યાર્થીની નહીં, પૂરા વિચારની, અને પૂરી શાળાની અને શિક્ષકની, બધાની થઇ જાય છે. પરંતુ વાલી તથા શિક્ષકના ટેકા વગર વિદ્યાર્થી એકલો હોય એ સ્થિતિ સારી નથી. શિક્ષક હોય, વાલી હોય, કે સિનિયર વિદ્યાર્થીઓ હોય એ બધાં મળીને એક ટીમ બનાવીને યુનિટ બનીને એક સરખા વિચાર સાથે યોજનાબદ્ધ રીતે આગળ વધીએ તો પરીક્ષા સરળ બની જાય છે.\nશ્રીમાન કેશવ વૈષ્ણવે મને એપ પર લખ્યું છે – એમણે ફરિયાદ કરી છે કે, માતાપિતાએ એમના બાળકો પર વધારે માર્કસ લાવવા માટે કયારેય દબાણ કરવું જોઇએ નહીં. માત્ર તૈયારી કરવા માટે તેમને પ્રોત્સાહીત કરવા જોઇએ. તેઓ હળવા રહે તેની ચિંતા કરવી જોઇએ.\nવિજય જિંદલ લખે છે – બાળકો પર પોતાની અપેક્ષાઓનો ભાર લાદવો જોઇએ નહીં, જેટલું થઇ શકે તેટલો એમનો ઉત્સાહ વધારો, વિશ્વાસ વધારવામાં સહાય કરો. આ વાત સાચી છે. આજે હું વાલીઓને વધારે કહેવા નથી ઇચ્છતો, કૃપા કરીને દબાણ વધારો નહી. જો બાળક તેના મિત્ર સાથે વાત કરી રહ્યો છે તો એને રોકો નહીં. એક હળવાશભર્યું વાતાવરણ બનાવો, સકારાત્મક વાતાવરણ બનાવો, તમારો દિકરો હોય કે દિકરી, જુઓ કેટલો કોન્ફીડન્સ આવી જાય છે. તમે પણ એ કોન્ફીડન્સ જોઇ શકશો.\nદોસ્તો, એક વાત નિશ્ચિત છે, ખાસ કરીને હું યુવા મિત્રોને કહેવા ઇચ્છું છું. આપણા લોકોનું જીવન આપણી જૂની પેઢીઓ કરતાં ખૂબ બદલાઇ ગયું છે. દરેક પળે નવી શોધ, નવી ટેકનોલોજી, વિજ્ઞાનના નીતનવા રંગરૂપ જોવા મળે છે. અને આપણે માત્ર અભિભૂત થઇએ છીએ એવું નથી. એમાં જોડાઇ જવાનું આપણે પસંદ કરીએ છીએ આપણે પણ વિજ્ઞાનની રફતારથી આગળ જવા ઇચ્છીએ છીએ.\nહું આ વાત એટલા માટે કરી રહ્યો છું કે, આજે રાષ્ટ્રિય વિજ્ઞાન દિવસ છે. દેશનો વિજ્ઞાન મહોત્સવ 28 ફેબ્રુઆરીએ રાષ્ટ્રિય વિજ્ઞાન દિવસ તરીકે મનાવીએ છીએ. 28 ફેબ્રુઆરી, 1928 સર.સી.વી.રમનને એમની શોધ રમન ઇફેક્ટની ઘોષણા કરી હતી. આ શોધ માટે તેમને નોબલ પુરસ્કાર પ્રાપ્ત થયો હતો. આથી દેશ 28 ફેબ્રુઆરીને રાષ્ટ્રિય દિવસના રૂપમાં ઉજવે છે. જિજ્ઞાસા વિજ્ઞાનની જનની છે. દરેક મનમાં વૈજ્ઞાનિક વિચાર હોય, વિજ્ઞાન પ્રતિ આકર્ષણ હોય અને દરેક પેઢીએ નવી શોધો પર ભાર મૂકવાનો હોય છે. અને વિજ્ઞાન તથા ટેકનોલોજી વગર નવી શોધ સંભવિત નથી થઇ શકતી. આજ રાષ્ટ્રિય વિજ્ઞાન દિવસ પર દેશમાં નવી શોધ પર ભાર મૂકાય. જ્ઞાનવિજ્ઞાન, ટેકનોલોજી આ બધી બાબતો આપણી વિકાસયાત્રાનો સહજ હિસ્સો બનવો જોઇએ. અને આ વખતે રાષ્ટ્રિય વિજ્ઞાન દિવસનો થીમ છે. મેક ઇન ઇન્ડિયા સાયન્સ એન્ડ ટેકનોલોજીલ driven Innovations. સર સી.વી.રમનને હું પ્રણામ કરૂં છું અને આપ સૌને વિજ્ઞાન પ્રતિ રૂચિ વધારવા માટે આગ્રહ કરી રહ્યો છું.\nદોસ્તો, કયારેક કયારેક સફળતાઓ ખૂબ સમય પછી મળે છે અને જયારે સફળતા મળે છે, ત્યારે દુનિયાને જોવાની દ્રષ્ટિ બદલાઇ જાય છે. તમે પરીક્ષામાં ખૂબ વ્યસ્ત રહ્યાં હશો, તો તમે કદાચ, શકય છે ઘણાબધા સમાચારો તમારા મનમાં નોંધાયા ન હોય. પરંતુ હું દેશવાસીઓને પણ આ વાત ફરીથી કહેવા ઇચ્છું છું. તમે પાછલા દિવસોમાં સાંભળ્યું હશે કે વિજ્ઞાનના વિશ્વમાં ખૂબ મોટી અને મહત્વપૂર્ણ શોધ થઇ છે. વિશ્વના વૈજ્ઞાનિકોએ પરિશ્રમ કર્યો, પેઢીઓ આવતી ગઇ, કંઇને કંઇ કરતી ગઇ અને લગભગ સો વર્ષ પછી એક સફળતા હાથ લાગી.\nઆપણા વૈજ્ઞાનિકોના પુરૂષાર્થ થકી Gravitational Waves ની શોધ ઉજાગર થઇ. આ શોધ વિજ્ઞાનની ખૂબ દૂરગામી સફળતા છે. આ શોધ પાછલી સદીના આપણા મહાન વૈજ્ઞાનિક આઇનસ્ટાઇનની થીયરીને જ પ્રમાણિત નથી કરતી, પરંતુ ભૌતિકશાસ્ત્ર માટે મહાન ડીસ્કવરી મનાય છે. આ સમગ્ર માનવજાતને સમગ્ર વિશ્વને કામમાં આવશે. પરંતુ એક ભારતીય હોવાના નાતે આપણને એ વાતનો આનંદ છે કે, સમગ્ર શોધની પ્રક્રિયામાં આપણા દેશના સપૂત આપણા દેશના હોનહાર વૈજ્ઞાનિકો જોડાયેલા હતાં. એમનું પણ યોગદાન છે.\nએ બધાં વૈજ્ઞાનિકોને આજે હું હૃદયપૂર્વક વધાવું છું. અભિનંદન આપું છું. ભવિષ્યમાં પણ શોધને આગળ વધારવામાં આપણા વૈજ્ઞાનિકો પ્રયાસરત રહેશે. આંતરરાષ્ટ્રીય પ્રયાસોમાં ભારત પણ હિસ્સેદાર બનશે. અને મારા દેશવાસીઓ, પાછલા દિવસોમાં એક મહત્વપૂર્ણ નિર્ણય કર્યો છે. આ શોધમાં હજી વધારે સફળતા પામવા માટે Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ટૂંકમાં જેને લીગો કહે છે. તેને ભારતમાં ખોલવાનો સરકારે નિર્ણય લીધો છે. દુનિયામાં બે સ્થળે આ પ્રકારની વ્યવસ્થા છે, ભારત ત્રીજું છે. ભારતના જોડાવાથી આ પ્રક્રિયાને નવી શક્તિ અને નવી ગતિ મળશે. ભારત જરૂર પોતાના મર્યાદિત સંસાધનોની વચ્ચે માનવકલ્યાણની આ મોટેરી વૈજ્ઞાનિક શોધપ્રક્રિયામાં સક્રિય ભાગીદાર બનશે. ફરી એકવાર હું બધા વૈજ્ઞાનિકોને વધાવું છું, શુભકામનાઓ પાઠવું છું.\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, તમને હું એક નંબર લખાવું છું. કાલથી તમે એ નંબર પર મીસ્ડકોલ કરીને મારી ‘મનની વાત’ સાંભળી શકો છો. તમારી માતૃભાષામાં પણ સાંભળી શકશો. મીસ્ડકોલ કરવા માટેનો નંબર છે, 81908 – 81908 ફરી હું કહું છું. ૮૧૯૦૮ – ૮૧૯૦૮\nદોસ્તો, તમારી પરીક્ષા શરૂ થઇ રહી છે. મારે પણ કાલે પરીક્ષા આપવાની છે. સવાસો કરોડ દેશવાસી મારી પરીક્ષા લેવાના છે. ખબર છે ને, અરે ભાઇ કાલે બજેટ છે. 29 ફેબ્રુઆરી, આ લીપ વર્ષ હોય છે. પરંતુ હા, તમે જોયું હશે, મને સાંભળતા જ લાગ્યું હશે, હું કેટલો સ્વસ્થ છું, કેટલા આત્મવિશ્વાસથી ભરેલો છું બસ, કાલે મારી પરીક્ષા થઇ જાય, પરમદિવસથી તમારી પરીક્ષા શરૂ થઇ જાય અને આપણે બધાં સફળ થઇએ, તો દેશ પણ સફળ થશે.\nતો મિત્રો, તમને પણ ખૂબ ખૂબ શુભકામનાઓ, સફળતા-નિષ્ફળતાના તણાવથી મુક્તમનથી આગળ વધો, લાગ્યા રહો,\nધન્યવાદ..\nJ.Khunt/GP\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

        "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fbklkgwr-4",
        "article": "\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, नमस्कार, आपण रेडिओवरुन माझी “मन की बात” ऐकत आहात. पण मनात मात्र काही वेगळेच सुरु आहे. मुलांच्या परिक्षा आता सुरु होतील, काही जणांच्या दहावी-बारावीच्या परीक्षा बहुधा 1 मार्च पासूनच सुरु होतील. तुमच्या मनात आता परीक्षेचेच विचार सुरु असतील. या तुमच्या प्रवासात मीही तुमच्याबरोबर सहभागी होऊ इच्छितो. तुम्हाला तुमच्या मुलांच्‍या परीक्षेबद्दल जेवढी काळजी वाटते, तितकीच मलाही वाटते आहे. पण परीक्षेकडे बघण्याचा आपला दृष्टिकोन आपण बदलला तर आपण चिंतामुक्त होऊ शकतो. माझ्या मन की बात कार्यक्रमाच्या मागच्या भागात मी आपल्याला सांगितले होते की तुमचे अनुभव, तुमच्या सूचना नरेंद्र मोदी ॲपवर मला पाठवा. शिक्षकांनी, जीवनात उत्तम यश मिळवलेल्या विद्यार्थ्यांनी, समाजाच्या हितचिंतकांनी अनेक गोष्टी या ॲपवर लिहून माझ्याकडे पाठवल्या, याचा मला आनंद वाटतो. यात दोन मुद्दे मला विशेषत्वाने जाणवले. एक म्हणजे सूचना पाठवणाऱ्यांनी, अनुभव लिहिणाऱ्यांनी विषयाला धरुन, मुद्दा न सोडता लिहिले, आणि दुसरे म्हणजे हजारोंच्या संख्येने सूचना आणि अनुभव या ॲपवर नागरिकांनी पाठवले. मला वाटते हाच यातला महत्त्वाचा भाग आहे, महत्त्वाचा षयक आहे. पण झाले असे की परीक्षा हा विषय, आपली शाळा, कुटुंब किंवा विद्यार्थी या पुरताच मर्यादित ठेवला आहे. माझ्या ॲपवर जया सूचना आल्या त्यावरुन वाटतंय की, हा महत्त्वाचा विषय आहे, पूर्ण देशभर विद्यार्थ्यांशी संबंधित या मुद्दयांची चर्चा सातत्याने व्हायला हवी.\nआज माझ्या मन की बात कार्यक्रमातून खास करुन पालकांशी, विद्यार्थ्यांशी आणि शिक्षकांशी मला बोलायचे आहे. मी जे ऐकले आहे, जे वाचले आहे, मला जे सांगितले गेले , त्यातल्या काही गोष्टी मी सांगेन, मला स्वत:ला जे वाटते तेही सांगेन. पण जे विद्यार्थी परीक्षेला सामोरे जाणार आहेत, त्यांना माझा हा 25-30 मिनिटांचा संवाद निश्चित उपयोगी ठरेल असा मला विश्वास वाटतो.\nमाझ्या प्रिय विद्यार्थी मित्रांनो, मी तुमच्याशी काही बोलण्याच्या आधी, आजच्या “मन की बात”ची सुरुवात, जगातील एका विख्यात ओपनरकडून केली तर ? जीवनात यशाची शिखरे गाठताना, त्यांना काय काय उपयोगी पडेल ? त्यांचे अनुभव तुम्हाला नक्कीच उपयोगी ठरतील. भारतभरातील तरुण वर्गाला ज्यांच्याबद्दल अभिमान वाटतो त्या भारतरत्न श्रीमान सचिन तेंडुलकर यांनी तुमच्यासाठी एक संदेश पाठवलाय, तो मी तुम्हाला ऐकवतो.\n“नमस्‍कार, मी सचिन तेंडूलकर बोलतो आहे. काहीच दिवसात परीक्षा सुरु होणार आहेत, हे मला माहित आहे. आपल्यापैकी काही जण तणावाखाली असतील. माझा एकच संदेश आहे. तुम्हाला, तुमचे आई वडिल तुमच्याकडून अपेक्षा ठेवतील, तुमचे शिक्षक ठेवतील, तुमच्या कुटुंबातील इतर सदस्य ठेवतील, तुमचे मित्रही ठेवतील. तुम्ही कुठेही गेलात, तरी सर्व विचारतील तुमची तयारी कशी सुरु आहे ? तुम्ही किती टक्के गुण मिळवाल ? मला हेच सांगायचे की तुम्ही स्वत:च स्वत:साठी एक ध्येय निश्चित करा, दुसऱ्या कोणाच्या अपेक्षांच्या दबावाखाली येऊ नका. तुम्ही जरुर मेहनत करा, पण एक वास्तववादी, साध्य होण्याजोगे ध्येय सवत:साठी निश्चित करा आणि ते ध्येय साध्य करण्यासाठी प्रयत्न करा. मी जेव्हा क्रिकेट खेळत होतो, तेव्हा माझ्याकडून खूप साऱ्या अपेक्षा होत्या. गेल्‍या 24 वर्षात अनेक कठीण क्षण आले आणि अनेकदा चांगले क्षणही आले. पण लोकांच्या अपेक्षा नेहमीच असत आणि त्या वाढतच गेल्‍या, जसजसा काळ पुढे जात राहिला, तसतशा अपेक्षाही वाढत गेल्या. आणि त्यासाठी मला एक उपाय शोधणे गरजेचे होते. तेव्हा मी असा विचार केला की मी स्वत: माझ्या अपेक्षा ठेवीन आणि स्वत:च स्वत:चे ध्येय निश्चित करीन. जर का मी स्वत:च स्वत:चे ध्येय निश्चित करत असेन, आणि ते साध्य करु शकत असेन, तर मी देशासाठी नक्कीच काही ना काही चांगले करु शकतो आहे. आणि मग तेच ध्येय साध्य करण्यासाठी मी प्रयत्न करत असे. माझे लक्ष चेंडूवर केंद्रीत असायचे आणि मग आपणहूनच सर्व ध्येय साध्य होत गेली. मी तुम्हाला हेच सांगू इच्छितो की, तुम्ही, आणि तमुचे विचार सकारात्मक असणे अत्यंत गरजेचे आहे. सकारात्मक विचारांपाठोपाठ सकारात्मक परिणाम येतील. त्यामुळे तुम्ही निश्चित सकारात्मक रहा आणि ईश्वर तुम्‍हाला नक्कीच चांगले परिणाम देईल याची मला पूर्ण आशा आहे आणि मी तुम्हाला परिक्षेसाठी हार्दिक शुभेच्छा देऊ इच्छितो. तणावमुक्त होऊन पेपर लिहा आणि चांगला निकाल मिळवा शुभेच्छा.\nपाहिलंत मित्रांनो, तेंडुलकरजी काय सांगत होते ? अपेक्षांच्या ओझ्याखाली दबून जाऊ नका. तुमचे भवितव्य तुम्हाला घडवायचे आहे. तुमचे उद्दिष्ट तुम्हीच ठरवा, तुमचे ध्येय तुम्हीच ठरता, मुक्त मनाने, मुक्त विचाराने आणि मुक्त सामर्थ्याने सचिनजींनी सांगितलेल्या गोष्टी तुम्हाला उपयोगी पडतील असा मला विश्वास आहे. आणि हे ही तितकेच खरे आहे की, प्रतिस्पर्धा कशासाठी ? अनुस्पर्धा, स्वयंस्पर्धा का नसावी ? इतरांशी स्पर्धा करण्यात आपला वेळ का वाया घालवावा ? आपण आपल्या स्वत:शी स्पर्धा का करु नये ? आपणच याआधी गाठलेली यशाची शिखरे ओलांडून नवी शिखरे पादाक्रांत करायचा, निश्चिय का करु नये ? तुम्ही बघाल की, कुणीही तुम्हाला पुढे जायला रोखू शकणार नाही, आणि याआधी मिळवलेल्या यशापेक्षाही अधिक यश तुम्ही मिळवाल, तेव्हा आनंद मिळवण्यासाठी, समाधान मिळवण्यासाठी दुसऱ्या कुणावर अवलंबून राहण्याची तुम्हाला आवश्यकता वाटणार नाही. आत्मसमाधानाचा अनुभव घ्याल.\nमित्रांनो, परीक्षा म्हणजे गुणांचा, आकडयांचा खेळ मानू नका. कुठे पोचलो, किती मिळवले ? या हिशोबात अडकू नका. एखाद्या महान उद्देशासाठी जगण्याला जोडून घ्या. मनात स्वप्न घेऊन चालायला हवे, संकल्पबध्द असायला हवे. आपण योग्य पध्दतीने पुढे चाललोय का ? हे या परीक्षांमधून कळते, आपली गति योग्य आहे का ? हे या परीक्षांमधून समजते. आणि म्हणून तुमची स्वप्न विराट, विशाल असतील तर परीक्षा म्हणजे आपोआपच आनंदाचा उत्सव होईल. तुम्ही ठरवलेल्या महान उद्देशाची पूर्तता करण्यासाठी, परीक्षा म्हणजे एक पाऊल ठरेल. तुम्हाला मिळणारे प्रत्येक यश म्हणजे ते महान-उद्दिष्ट साध्य करण्याची जणू किल्ली ठरेल. आणि म्हणूनच यावर्षी काय होईल ? या परिक्षेत काय होईल ? एवढयावरच स्वत:ला मर्यादित ठेवू नका. डोळयासमोर एक महान ध्येय ठेवून वाटचाल करा, आणि त्यातही अपेक्षापेक्षा कमी यश मिळाले तरी निराशा वाटणार नाही, अधिक जोमाने, अधिक ताकदीने, अधिक प्रयत्न करण्याची प्रेरणा मिळेल.\nहजारो नागरिकांनी माझ्या ॲपवर, त्यांच्या मोबाईलमधून छोटे छोटे मुद्दे लिहून पाठवले आहेत. निरोगी शरीरातच निरोगी मन असते या मुद्दयावर श्रेय गुप्ता यांनी भर दिला आहे, विद्यार्थ्यांनी अभ्यासाबरोबर, स्वत:च्या आरोग्यकडेही लक्ष द्यायला हवे. त्यामुळे परीक्षेच्या काळात अडचणी येणार नाहीत. आता अगदी शेवटच्या दिवशी, आयत्यावेळी मी तुम्हाला सांगणार नाही की तुम्ही जोर-बैठका काढा, तीन किलोमीटर, पाच किलोमीटर धावायला जा, पण परीक्षेच्या काळात आपली दिनचर्या कशी असावी ? हे महत्त्वाचे आहे. खरे तर पूर्ण वर्षभर, 365 दिवस, आपली दिनचर्या, आपल्या स्वप्नांना आणि संकल्पनांना अनुकूल असायला हवी. श्रीमान प्रभाकर रेड्डी यांनी मांडलेला एक मुद्दा मला पटला. वेळेवर झोपलो आणि पहाटे लवकर उठून अभ्यासाची उजळणी करणे याबद्दल ते आग्रहाने लिहितात. प्रवेशपत्र आणि अन्य आवश्यक गोष्टींसह परीक्षा केंद्रावर वेळेत पोहोचयला हवे असे प्रभाकर रेड्डी म्हणतात. हे सांगायचे धाडस मी कदाचित केले नसते, कारण झोपेच्या बाबतीत मी फारसा गंभीर नाहीये. आणि मी पुरेशी झोप घेत नाही अशी माझ्या बऱ्याच मित्रांची तक्रार असते. हे माझ्यातील न्यून काढून टाकण्याचा मी प्रयत्न करीन. पण हा मुद्दा मला पटला. झोपण्याची निश्चित वेळ, गाढ झोप हे तितकेच महत्त्वाचे आहे जितक्या आपल्या दिवसभरातील अन्य गोष्टी महत्त्वाच्या असतात. मी नशीबवान आहे. माझी झोप कमी आहे पण गाढ मात्र आहे आणि तेवढी मला पुरते. पण तुम्हाला मात्र मी आवर्जून सांगेन. नाहीतर काही लोकांना सवय असते, झोपण्यापूर्वी दूरध्वनीवर बराच वेळ बोलत राहायचे. आता तेच विचार मनात असतील तर झोप कशी येणार ? आणि झोपण्याबद्दल मी सांगतोय तेव्हा असे मानू नका समजू की परीक्षेसाठी झोपण्याबद्दल मी सांगतोय. गैरसमज नका करुन घेऊ. परीक्षेच्या काळात, तुम्ही तणावमुक्त अवस्थेत परीक्षा द्यावी यासाठी मी झोपेबद्दल बोलतोय. झोपून रहा असे मला म्हणायचे नाही. नाहीतर असे नको व्हायला की परीक्षेत कमी गुण मिळाले, आणि आईने कारण विचारले तर सांगाल, की मोदीजींनी, झोपायला सांगितले होते, म्हणून मी झोपलो. तुम्ही असे नाही ना करणार ? मला खात्री आहे, नाही करणार.\nजीवनात शिस्त असणे हा यशाचा पाया भक्कम असण्याचे महत्त्वाचे कारण आहे. हा भक्कम पाया शिस्तीमुळेच असू शकतो. आणि जे विस्कळीत असतात, बेशिस्त असतात, सकाळी करायचे काम संध्याकाळी करतात, दुपारी करायचे काम रात्री उशिरापर्यंत करतात, त्यांना असे वाटते की काम झाले पण त्यात त्यांची खूप ऊर्जा वाया जाते आणि क्षणोक्षणी ते तणावाखाली असतात. आपल्या शरीराचा एखादा अवयव थोडा दुखत असेल तर आपण अस्वस्थ असतो हे तुम्ही अनुभवले असेल. एवढेच नाही तर दिनचर्याही त्यामुळे बिघडते. आणि म्हणून कोणतीही गोष्ट लहान, किरकोळ समजू नका. तुम्ही बघा, तुम्ही जे साध्य करायचे ठरवले आहे, त्याच्या बाबतीत तडजोड करण्याची सवय लावून घेऊ नका. ठरवा, करुन बघा.\nमित्रांनो, मी असेही काही वेळा बघितले आहे की परीक्षा दयायला जे विद्यार्थी जातात. त्यांच्यात दोन प्रकार असतात. आपण काय वाचले आहे ? काय शिकलो ? आपली बलस्थाने कोणती ? या विषयावर लक्ष केंद्रीत करणारे काही विद्यार्थी असतात आणि दुसऱ्या प्रकारातले विद्यार्थी, कोण जाणे काय प्रश्न असतील ? कुणाला माहित कसे प्रश्न असतील ? माहित नाही सोडवायला जमेल की नाही ? प्रश्नपत्रिका कठीण असेल की सोपी ? या विवंचनेत असतात. या दोन्ही प्रकारचे विद्यार्थी आपण बघितले असतील. प्रश्नपत्रिका कशी असेल ? या ताणाखाली जे असतात, त्या ताणाचा नकारात्मक प्रभाव त्यांच्या निकालावर पडतो. आणि जो अभ्यास मी केला आहे त्या बळावर मी कोणतीही प्रश्नपत्रिका सोडवेन अशा आत्मविश्वासाने जे जातात ते कशीही प्रश्नपत्रिका आली तर निर्धाराने सोडवतात. याबाबतीत माझ्यापेक्षा अधिक चांगल्या पध्दतीने तुम्हाला कुणी सांगू शकत असेल तर ते आहेत, काटशह, देण्यात ज्यांचे प्रभूत्व आहे आणि जगभरातील भल्या-भल्यांना ज्यांनी काटशह दिला आहे ते जगविख्यात बुध्दीबळपटू विश्वनाथन् आनंद. 64 चौकडयांच्‍या राजाने अनुभव सांगितले आहेत. या परिक्षेला काटशह देऊन यश मिळविण्याचा मार्ग आपण त्यांच्याकडूनच जाणून घेऊ या.\nनमस्कार मी विश्वनाथन आनंद. तुम्हाला परीक्षेसाठी शुभेच्छा देऊन मला सुरुवात करु द्या. मी माझ्या परीक्षेसाठी कसा जायचो आणि त्याबाबतचा माझा अनुभव मी आता सांगणार आहे. परीक्षा, हया तुमच्या असण्यात नंतर येणाऱ्या समस्यांप्रमाणेच असतात, हे मला जाणवले. तुम्ही व्यवस्थित आराम केला पाहिजे, रात्रीची शांत झोप घेतली पाहिजे, तुम्ही पोटभर खाल्ले पाहिजे, तुम्ही नक्कीच भुके राहता कामा नये आणि सर्वात महत्त्वाची गोष्ट म्हणजे, तुम्ही शांत राहिले पाहिजे. महत्त्वाची गोष्ट म्हणजे, तुम्ही शांत राहिले पाहिजे. हे सर्व बुध्दीबळाच्या डावाप्रमाणेच आहे. जेव्हा तुम्ही खेळत असता, तेव्हा तुम्हाला माहिती नसते, कोणते प्यादे समोर येणार आहे, त्याचप्रमाणे वर्गातही तुम्हाला माहित नसते, की परीक्षेत कोणता प्रश्न येणार आहे ? म्हणूनच तुम्ही जर शांत राहिलात आणि तुम्ही पोटभर खाल्ले असेल, तुमची नीट झोप झालेली असेल तर तुम्हाला कळेल की तुमच्या मेंदूला योग्य वेळी योग्य उत्तर आठवते. त्यामुळे शांत रहा. स्वत:ला जास्त ताण देऊ नका, अति अपेक्षा ठेवू नका. हे महत्वपूर्ण आहे, याकडे एक आव्हान म्हणून पहा – वर्षभरात मला जे शिकवले ते मला आवठतेय का, मी हे प्रश्न सोडवू शकतो का ? अगदी शेवटच्या क्षणी सर्वात महत्त्वाच्या गोष्टीची पुन्हा उजळणी करा, ज्या गोष्टी आठवत नाही त्या आठवून पहा, तुम्ही परीक्षा देत असताना तुम्हाला कदाचित शिक्षकांबरोबरचे किंवा विद्यार्थ्यांबरोबरचे काही प्रसंग आठवतील आणि यामुळे तुम्हाला त्या विषयाबाबतचे बरेच काही आठवायला मदत होईल. जर का तुम्ही कठीण वाटणाऱ्या प्रश्नांची उजळणी केली तर तुम्हाला असे लक्षात येईल की ते तुमच्यासाठी नवीनच प्रश्न आहेत आणि मग जेव्हा तुम्ही परीक्षा द्याल तेव्हा तुम्ही ते अधिक चांगल्या प्रकारे सोडवू शकाल. त्यामुळे शांत रहा. रात्रीची चांगली झोप घ्या, अति आत्मविश्वास दाखवू नका पण त्याचवेळी निराशावादीही राहू नका. मला नेहमीच असे आढळून आले आहे की तुम्हाला भीती वाटत होती त्यापेक्षा या परीक्षा अधिक चांगल्या जातात. त्यामुळे आत्मविश्वासपूर्ण रहा. आणि तुम्हाला खूप खूप शभेच्छा.\nविश्वनाथन्‌ आनंद यांनी खरोरखरच महत्त्वाची गोष्ट सांगितली. आणि आंतरराष्ट्रीय बुध्दीबळ सामना खेळताना तुम्हीही त्यांना पाहिले असेल, की ते कसे ठामपणे बसतात. एकाग्र होऊन बसतात, त्यांची नजरसुध्दा किंचित विचलित होत नाही हे तुम्ही बघितले असेल. अर्जुन आणि पक्षाचा डोळा ही गोष्ट आपण ऐकली आहे. अर्जुनाची दृष्टी जशी त्‍या पक्षाच्या डोळयावरच खिळली होती, त्याप्रमाणेच विश्वनाथन्‌ आनंद यांची दृष्टी केवळ ध्येयाकडेच केंद्रीत झालेली असते आणि स्वत:मधील शांतीची ती अभिव्यक्ती असते, प्रगटीकरण असते. आता जर कोणी असे म्हणेल की यामुळे आतील शांतीवस्था येणारच. तर असे सांगणे कठीण आहे हे खरे आहे. पण प्रयत्न केले पाहिजेत. ते हसत हसत का करु नयेत ? तुम्ही बघा, हसत रहा अगदी परीक्षेच्या काळातही हास्य विनोदाचा मनमोकळा आनंद घ्याल, तर हा शांततेचा अनुभव तुम्हाला आपोआप येईल.\nतुम्ही मित्रांशी बोलत नाही, एकटेच जाता, कोमेजून गेल्‍यासारखे राहता, शेवटच्या क्षणापर्यंत पुस्तक धुंडाळत राहता तर मग तुमचे मन शांत राहणार नाही. हसा, खळखळून हसा, मित्रांबरोबर विनोद, गंमती यांची देवाण घेवाण करा. आणि मग बघा शांत वातावरण कसे आपोआपच निर्माण होते ते.\nएक छोटी गोष्ट मी तुम्हाला समजावून सांगतो. अशी कल्पना करा, की तुम्ही एका तलावाच्या काठावर उभे आहात, आणि नितळ, पारदर्शक पाण्यामधून, पाण्याखालच्या गोष्टी स्वच्छ दिसत आहेत. पण अचानक त्या पाण्यात कुणीतरी दगड टाकला, तर पाणी डचमळू लागेल. आणि पाण्याखालच्या गोष्टी ज्या स्वच्छ दिसत होत्या, त्या आता दिसतील का ?\nजर पाणी शांत असेल तर अगदी खोलवरच्या गोष्टीही दिसतात पण पाण्याचा पृष्ठभाग विचलित झाला तर खालचे काहीच दिसत नाही. तुमच्याजवळ खूप काही आहे. वर्षभर तुम्ही केलेल्या मेहनतीचे संचित तुमच्यापाशी आहे. पण तुमचे मन शांत नसेल तर हे संचित गवसणार नाही. आणि मन स्थिर असेल तर, या साऱ्या मेहनतीचे फलित स्पष्टपणे तुमच्यासमोर येईल आणि तुम्ही परीक्षा सहज, निर्विघ्न देऊ शकाल.\nमाझ्या बाबतीतली एक गोष्टी मी तुम्हाला सांगतो. कधी कधी मी एखादे व्याख्यान ऐकायला जातो किंवा सरकार चालवताना असे काही मुद्दे, विषय समोर येतात ज्याबद्दल मला माहित नसते, आणि मला अधिक एकाग्रतेने त्याकडे पहावे लागते, कधी कधी विशेष लक्ष देऊन विषय समजून घेण्याचा प्रयत्न मी करतो. त्यावेळी अनुभव येतो आतल्या ताणाचा. मग मला वाटते की थोडा आराम केला तर बरे वाटेल. त्यासाठी मी स्वत:च एक तंत्र विकसित केले आहे. मी दीर्घ श्वसन करतो, खोलवर श्वास घेतो, तीन वेळा, पाच वेळा खोल श्वास घेतो. या सगळयासाठी 30 सेकंद, 40 सेकंद किंवा 50 सेकंद लागतात, पण हे केल्यानंतर माझे मन शांत होते आणि विषय समजून घेण्यासाठी मनाची तयारी होते. हा माझा अनुभव तुम्हालाही उपयोगी पडेल असेही शक्य आहे.\nरजत अग्रवाल यांनी एक चांगली गोष्ट सांगितली आहे. माझ्या ॲपवर जे लिहितात, “ रोज कमीत कमी अर्धातास तरी आपण आपल्या मित्रांबरोबर, कुटुंबियांवर आनंदात वेळ घालवायला हवा. त्यांच्याशी गप्पा मारायला हव्यात.\nही एक महत्त्वाची गोष्‍ट रजतजींनी सांगितली कारण आपण अनुभवले असेल की, जेव्हा आपण परीक्षा देऊन घरी येतो. तेव्हा काय लिहिले? किती सोडवले? याचा धांडोळा घ्यायला बसतो. किती चुकले? काय बरोबर लिहिले? हे तपासायला लागतो. घरात आईवडील शिकलेले असतील आणि त्यातही ते शिक्षक असतील, तर पूर्ण प्रश्नपत्रिका तुम्हाला पुन्हा सोडवायला लावतात. सांग, काय लिहिलेस? काय आले? आणि मग गुणांची बेरीज करुन दाखवतात. बघ तुला 40 मिळतील की 80 की 90 गुण. ज्‍या विषयाची प्रश्नपत्रिका सोडवून तुम्ही आलात. त्याच विषयात तुमचे मन गुंतून राहते. आणि तुम्ही काय करता? मित्रांना फोन करुन विचारता अरे तू काय लिहिलेस? तो विषय तुला कसा गेला? काय वाटतेय तुला? अरे मी गडबड केली, माझे चुकलेच, मित्रा काय करु मला माहित होते पण आठवलेच नाही रे, आपण यातच अडकून जातो.\nमित्रांनो, असे करु नका. उत्तरपत्रिकेत जे लिहिले ते लिहिले, आता इतर विषयांवर घरातल्यांशी बोला. जुने आनंदाचे क्षण आठवा. आई-वडीलांबरोबर एखाद्या ठिकाणी कधी गेला असाल तर ते क्षण आठवा, अभ्यास, परीक्षा यातून बाहेर पडून किमान अर्धा तास यासाठी द्या. रजतजींनी सांगितलेला मुद्दा समजून घ्यावा असाच आहे.\nमित्रहो, “शांती” या विषयावर मी काय तुम्हाला सांगणार? आज तुम्ही परीक्षा द्यायला जायच्या आधी, अशा एका व्यक्तीने तुमच्याकरता संदेश पाठवला आहे की जे मूळात शिक्षक आहेत आणि आज एका अर्थानं संस्कार शिक्षक झाले आहेत. रामचरित मानस या महान ग्रंथाला वर्तमानकाळाशी जोडून घेऊन देशभर आणि जगभर हा संस्कारांचा ओघ पोचवण्याचा प्रयत्न ते करत आहेत. त्या पूज्य मुरारी बापू यांनी विद्यार्थ्यांकरता एक क्लुप्ती सांगितली आहे. ते शिक्षक आहेत आणि चिंतनही करतात. या संदेशात या दोन्ही गोष्टींचं प्रत्यंतर येईल.\nमी मुरारी बापू बोलतोय. मी विद्यार्थी बंधू-भगिनींना हेच सांगू इच्छितो की परीक्षेच्या वेळी मनावर कोणताही ताण न ठेवता, विचारपूर्वक निर्णय घेऊन आणि एकाग्र चित्ताने परीक्षा द्या आणि जी परिस्थिती समोर आली आहे तिचा स्विकार करा. माझा अनुभव आहे की परिस्थितीचा स्विकार केला तर आपण खूप प्रसन्न आणि आनंदी राहू शकतो. तुमच्या परीक्षेत तुम्ही निर्भर होऊन आणि प्रसन्नचित्ताने पुढे गेलात तर जरुर यश मिळेल आणि जर कदाचित यश नाही मिळाले तरीही “नापास” झाल्याचे दु:ख होणार नाही आणि यशस्वी झाल्याचा अभिमानही वाटेल. एक शेर सांगून मी माझा संदेश आणि शुभेच्छा देतो. लाजिम नही कि हर कोई हो कामयाब ही, जीना भी सिखिए नाकामियों मे साथ | आपल्या आदरणीय पंतप्रधानांचा हा जो मन की बात कार्यक्रम आहे त्याचे मी खूप स्वागत करतो. सर्वांना माझ्या अनेक अनेक शुभेच्छा | धन्यवाद.\nएक मार्गदर्शक, मूल्यवान संदेश पाठवल्याबद्दल मी पूज्य मुरारी बापू यांचे आभार मानतो. मित्रहो आज आणखी एक गोष्ट मी आपल्याला सांगू इच्छितो. यावेळी नागरिकांनी, त्यांचे जे अनुभव माझ्यापर्यंत पोचवले त्यात योग विषयाची चर्चा केली आहे. हे माझ्या लक्षात आले. आणि मला याचा आनंद वाटतो की, जगभरात मी जिथे जातो, तिथे मला भेटणाऱ्या व्यक्ति थोडा वेळ का होईना, योग या विषयावर बोलतात. ती व्यक्ती परदेशी असो, भारतीय असो, योगाबद्दल लोकांच्या मनात आकर्षण निर्माण होऊ लागले आहे. याचा मला आनंद वाटतो. नागरिकांना या विषयी जाणून घेण्याची जिज्ञासा निर्माण झाली आहे हेच बघा ना, श्री. अतनु मंडल, श्री. के. जी. आनंद, श्री. अभिजीत कुलकर्णी आणि असे खूप जण, ज्यांनी ध्यानधारणेबद्दल, लिहिलेय माझ्या ॲपवर, योग यावर त्यांनी भर दिला आहे. असो, मित्रहो, तुम्ही उद्यापासून योगसाधना करायला लागा, असे मी आज आपल्याला सांगितले. तर ते काही योग्य नाही. पण जे विद्यार्थी नियमितपणे योगासने करतात त्यांनी आज परीक्षा आहे म्हणून योगासने केली नाही, असे करु नये. मात्र एक गोष्ट निश्चित. विद्यार्थीदशा असो की आयुष्याचा उत्तरार्ध अंतर्मनाचा विकास साधण्याच्या प्रवासात योगसाधना ही जणू गुरुकिल्ली आहे. यावर तुम्ही वश्य लक्ष द्या. आपल्या आसपास योगसाधना करणारे, योगविद्या जाणणारे कुणी असतील, तर त्यांना अवश्य भेटा. जरी यापूर्वी तुम्ही कधीही योगविद्येचा अभ्यास केला नसेल, तरीही योगसाधनेतल्या अशा काही सोप्या गोष्टी ते तुम्हाला सांगतील, ज्या चार ते पाच मिनिटात तुम्ही करु शकाल. बघा, तुम्हाला शक्य आहे का? माझा मात्र त्यावर पूर्ण विश्वास आहे.\nमाझ्या तरुण मित्रांनो, परीक्षा केंद्रात जाण्याची तुम्हाला फार घाई असते. पटापट जावे आणि आपल्या बाकावर बसावे, असे वाटते ना? हे सगळे घाईगडबडीत का करायचे? आपल्या पूर्ण दिवसाचे नियोजन असे का नसावे की रस्त्यात वाहनांच्या वर्दळीमुळे आपल्याला थांबावे लागले तरीही परीक्षा केंद्रावर आपण वेळेतच पोहचू. अन्यथा त्यामुळे मनात तणाव निर्माण होतो.\nआणखी एक गोष्ट, प्रश्नपत्रिकेच्या सुरुवातीला आपल्यासाठी काही सूचना असतात. आपण त्या वाचत बसलो, तर वेळ जाईल, असे आपल्याला वाटते. पण असे नाही मित्रांनो, त्या सूचना लक्षपूर्वक वाचा, दोन मिनिटे, तीन, पाच मिनिटे लागतील, काही बिघडत नाही. त्या सूचना बारकाईने वाचल्यामुळे, तुम्हाला हे कळेल की उत्तरपत्रिका कशी लिहायची आहे. त्या सूचना समजून घेतल्यात तर पश्चाताप करण्याची वेळ तुमच्यावर येणार नाही. प्रश्नपत्रिकेचे स्वरुप बदलले आहे, हे प्रश्नपत्रिका हातात पडल्यावर कळते, असेही मी बघितले आहे. अशावेळी या सूचना वाचून, समजून घेतल्या तर, बदललेल्या स्वरुपाशी आपण स्वत:ला जुळवून घेऊ शकतो. भले यासाठी तुमची पाच मिनिटे जातील, पण हे करा असे मी आपल्याला आवर्जून सांगेन.\nश्रीमान यश नागर यांनी त्यांचा अनुभव मोबाईल अपॅवर लिहून पाठवला आहे. ते लिहितात की, प्रश्नपत्रिका पहिल्यांदा नजरेखालून घातली तेव्हा ती फारच अवघड वाटली. पण तीच प्रश्नपत्रिका दुसऱ्यांदा वाचली आत्मविश्वासाने, तेव्हा लक्षात आले की आता हीच प्रश्नपत्रिका माझ्यासमारे आहे. आता कोणताही नवीन प्रश्न येणार नाही. यात आहेत, तेवढेच प्रश्न मला सोडवायचे आहेत. आणि मी पुन्हा विचार केला. पुढे यश नागर लिहितात की आता ही प्रश्नपत्रिका मला नीट समजली. पहिल्यांदा वाचली तेव्हा वाटले की आपल्याला यातले काहीच सोडवता येणार नाही. पण दुसऱ्यांदा वाचल्यावर लक्षात आले की, प्रश्न तेच आहेत, फक्त मांडणी वेगळ्या पद्धतीने केली आहे आणि त्याची उत्तरे मला माहित आहेत. प्रश्न समजून घेणे महत्त्वाचे आहे. तसे न केल्याने ते फार कठीण आहेत, असे आपल्याला वाटते. तुम्ही प्रश्न दोनदा, तीनदा, चार वेळा वाचा आणि तुम्ही केलेल्या अभ्यासाशी ते ताडून पहा. हा यश नागर यांनी मांडलेला मुद्दा आपण लक्षात घ्यावा, असे मी आपल्याला सुचवेन. आणि मग तुम्ही बघाल की किचकट वाटणाऱ्या प्रश्नांची उत्तरे कशी सहज लिहिता येतात ते.\nभारतरत्न आणि ज्येष्‍ठ वैज्ञानिक सी. एन. आर. राव यांनी त्यांच्या संदेशात धैर्य हा मुद्दा अधोरेखित केला आहे. याचा मला आज आनंद होतो आहे. किमान शब्दांमध्ये पण कमालीचा सुंदर संदेश राव साहेबांनी पाठवला आहे, आपण तो ऐकूया-\n“बंगळूरहून मी सी. एन. आर. राव बोलतोय. परीक्षांमुळे त्यातही स्पर्धात्मक परीक्षांमुळे अस्वस्थता येते हे मला पूर्ण माहित आहे. काळजी करु नका. तुमचे सर्वोत्तम द्या, हेच मी माझ्या सर्व तरुण मित्रांनो सांगतो. पण त्याचवेळी हेही लक्षात ठेवा की या देशात इतर अनेक संधी उपलब्ध आहे. आयुष्यात तुम्हाला काय करायचे आहे ते ठरवा आणि ते सोडू नका, तुम्ही यशस्वी व्हाल. तुम्ही या विश्वाची लेकरे आहात हे विसरु नका, झाडे आणि डोंगरांप्रमाणेच तुम्हालाही इथे राहायचा हक्क आहे. तुम्हाला गरज आहे ती निग्रहाची, समर्पणाची आणि चिकाटीची. या गुणांमुळे तुम्ही सर्व परीक्षा आणि इतर प्रयत्नांमधे यशस्वी व्हाल. तुम्हाला जे जे काही करायचे आहे, त्यासाठी मी तुम्हाला शुभेच्छा देतो. अनेक आशिर्वाद.”\nपाहिलेत, मुद्दा सांगण्याची एखाद्या वैज्ञानिकाची पद्धत कशी असते? जे सांगायला मला अर्धा तास लागतो, तेच ते तीन मिनिटात सांगतात. हीच तर विज्ञानाची शक्ती आहे आणि हीच वैज्ञानिकमनाची शक्ती आहे. देशभरातील मुलांना प्रेरणा दिल्याबद्दल मी राव साहेबांचा मी खूप आभारी आहे. दृढता, निष्ठा, तप याबद्दल ते बोलले. dedication, determination, diligence याबद्दल ते बोलले. ठामपणे उभे रहा मित्रांनो ठाम रहा. जर तुम्ही ठामपणाने उभे राहिलात तर, भितीलाही भिती वाटेल. आणि तुमच्या हातून सत्कृत्य व्हावे यासाठी सोनेरी भविष्यकाळ तुमची प्रतिक्षा करेल.\nरूचिका डाबस यांनी माझ्या ॲपवर संदेश पाठवला आहे. परीक्षेबद्दलचा त्यांचा अनुभव रुचिका यांनी सांगितला आहे. त्या म्हणतात की, परीक्षेच्या काळात घरामध्ये सकारात्मक वातावरण असावे, याकडे त्यांचे कुटुंबिय लक्ष देतात, अशीच चर्चा, असेच वातावरण शेजारच्या घरांमध्येही असते. सर्वत्र सकारात्मकता. आणि हे खरे आहे, सचिनजींनीही सांगितले, सकारात्मक दृष्टीकोन, मनाची सकारात्मक अवस्था यातून निर्माण होते, सकारात्मक ऊर्जा.\nआपल्याला प्रेरणा देतील अशा खूप गोष्टी कधी कधी घडतात. असा विचार करु नका की प्रेरणा फक्त विद्यार्थ्यांनाच मिळते. जगण्याच्या कोणत्याही क्षणी, आयुष्याच्या कोणत्याही वळणावर, उत्तम उदारणे, सत्य घटना फार मोठी प्रेरणा आपल्यालाही देतात, मोठं सामर्थ्य देतात आणि संकटाच्या वेळी याच प्रेरणेच्या बळावर नवा मार्ग सापडू शकतो.\nवीजेच्या दिव्याचे जनक थॉमस अल्वा एडीसन यांच्याबद्दलची माहिती अभ्यासक्रमात आपण वाचतो. पण मित्रांनो, कधी याचा विचार केलात का, की ह्या शोधासाठी किती वर्ष त्यांनी घालवली? अनेकदा अपयश सोसावे लागले, वेळ गेला, पैसेही खूप खर्च झाले. यश न मिळाल्याने किती उद्विग्न झाले असतील ते? पण त्यांनी जन्माला घातलेला तो वीजेचा दिवा आज आपल्या सगळ्यांचे आयुष्य प्रकाशमान करणारा ठरला. म्हणूनच तर म्हणतात अपयशाच्या पोटात यशाच्या शक्ता दडलेल्या असतात.\nश्रीनिवास रामानुजन हे नाव सर्वांना ठाऊक आहे. आधुनिक काळातील महान गणिततज्ञांमधले एक, भारतीय गणिततज्ञ.\nगणित या विषयाचे काही विशेष शिक्षण त्यांनी घेतले नव्हते, तरीही गणितीय वर्गीकरण, अंकसिद्धांत यासारख्या विविध क्षेत्रांमध्ये रामानुजन यांनी मोलाची भर घातली. अत्यंत हलाखीचं, कष्टप्रद जीवन त्यांच्या वाट्याला आले, तरीही या जगासाठी महान देणगी ते देऊन गेले.\nकुणालाही, कधीही यश मिळू शकते याचे उत्तम उदाहरण म्हणजे जे. के. रॉलिंग. हॅरी पॉटर ही त्यांची मालिका जगभर लोकप्रिय झाली. पण सुरुवातीचा काळ वेगळा होता, अनेक संकटांचा सामना त्यांना करावा लागला, अनेकदा निराशा वाट्याला आली. मात्र अशा परिस्थितीतही चिकाटीने त्यांची सारी शक्ती त्यांनी कामाला लावली, असे जे. के. रॉलिंग यांनी स्वत: सांगितले होते, हीच शक्ती त्यांच्यासाठी महत्त्वाची होती.\nआजच्या काळात परिक्षा ही फक्त विद्यार्थ्यांची नसते, सगळ्या कुटुंबाची, शाळेची, शिक्षकांची असते. पण पालक आणि शिक्षक यांचा पाठिंबा नसलेला विद्यार्थी असणे काही चांगले नाही. शिक्षक असोत, पालक असोत, वरच्या वर्गातले विद्यार्थी असोत, या सगळ्यांनी एकत्र येऊन, समान विचाराने विद्यार्थ्यांना पाठिंबा दिला तर विद्यार्थ्यांना परीक्षेची भिती वाटणार नाही.\nश्रीमान केशव वैष्णव यांनी माझ्या ॲपवर लिहिले आहे. अधिक गुण मिळवावे असा दबाव पालकांनी मुलांवर टाकू नये असे त्यांचे मत आहे. फक्त अभ्यासाच्या तयारीसाठी पालकांनी मुलांना प्रोत्साहन दिले पाहिजे. मुले चिंतामुक्त कशी राहतील, याची काळजी पालकांनी घ्यायला पाहिजे.\nआपल्या अपेक्षांचे ओझे पालकांनी मुलांवर लादू नये असे मत मांडले आहे विजय जिंदल यांनी. जेवढे शक्य असेल, तेवढे मुलांना प्रोत्साहन द्यावे, त्यांचा विश्वास टिकून राहील, यासाठी मदत करावी. जिंदल यांचा मुद्दा बरोबर आहे. मी आज पालकांना जास्त काही नाही सांगणार. कृपया, तुमच्या मुलांवर दबाव टाकू नका, तो त्याच्या मित्राशी बोलत असेल तर त्याला अडवू नका. एक हसतंखेळतं, सकारात्मक वातावरण तयार करा. आणि मग बघा, तुमचा मुलगा, तुमची मुलगी आत्मविश्वासाने परीक्षेला सामोरे जातील. हा आत्मविश्वास तुम्हालाही जाणवेल.\nमित्रहो, एक मात्र निश्चित आहे, विशेषत: माझ्या तरुण मित्रांना मी सांगू इच्छितो. आपल्या आधीच्या पिढ्यांच्या तुलनेत आपल्या जीवनात खूपच बदल झाले आहेत. नवीन संशोधन, नवीन तंत्रज्ञान, विज्ञान यांची नवनवी रुप क्षणोक्षणी पहायला मिळत आहेत. आणि हे पाहून आपण केवळ दिपून जातो, असे नाही, तर त्या साऱ्याशी हात मिळवायला, आपल्याला आवडते. विज्ञानाच्या वेगाने आपणही प्रगती करावी, असे आपल्याला वाटते. हे मी सांगतोय याचे कारण म्हणजे आज राष्ट्रीय विज्ञान दिवस आहे. विज्ञानाचा हा महोत्सव दरवर्षी साऱ्या देशभर आपण साजरा करतो, 28 फेब्रुवारी रोजी. 28 फेब्रुवारी 1928, सर. सी. व्ही. रमन यांनी रमन परिणाम याची घोषणा केली होती. याच शोधासाठी ते नोबेल पुरस्काराचे मानकरी ठरले.\nआणि त्याचे स्मरण म्हणून 28 फेब्रुवारी हा दिवस राष्ट्रीय विज्ञान दिवस म्हणून आपण साऱ्या देशभर साजरा करतो. जिज्ञासा ही विज्ञानाची जननी आहे. प्रत्येक मनात वैज्ञानिक विचार रुजावेत, विज्ञानाचे प्रत्येकाला आकर्षण वाटावे, नवीन संशोधनावर प्रत्येक पिढीला लक्ष द्यावे लागते. विज्ञान आणि तंत्रज्ञान यांच्या सहभागाशिवाय नवीन संशोधन शक्य नाही. आज राष्ट्रीय विज्ञान दिनी साऱ्या देशभर नवीन संशोधनाला चालना मिळाली पाहिजे.\nज्ञान, विज्ञान आणि तंत्रज्ञान या गोष्टी आमच्या विकास यात्रेचा सहज भाग व्हायला हव्यात आणि यावेळच्या राष्ट्रय विज्ञान दिनाची संकल्पना आहे, “मेक इन इंडिया सायन्स अँड टेक्नॉलॉजी ड्रिव्हन इनोव्हेशन्स.” मी सर सी.व्ही. रमन यांना प्रणाम करतो आणि आपण सर्वांनी विज्ञानाच्या क्षेत्रात अधिक रस घ्यावा असे आवर्जून सांगतो.\nमित्रहो, कधी कधी यश मिळण्यासाठी फार वेळ लागतो. आणि जेव्हा यश मिळते तेव्हा जगाकडे बघण्याचा आपला दृष्टीकोनही बदलतो. तुम्ही परीक्षेच्या तयारीत मग्न असाल, कदाचित काही बातम्या तुमच्यापर्यंत पोहचल्या नसतील किंवा तुम्ही त्याकडे लक्ष दिले नसेल. पण देशवासियांना मी ही गोष्ट पुन्हा सांगू इच्छितो. गेल्या काही दिवसात विज्ञान जगतात एक मोठा आणि महत्वाचा शोध लागला आहे हे आपण ऐकले असेल. जगभरातील वैज्ञानिकांनी मेहनत केली, अनेक पिढया आल्या, काही ना काही भर त्यांनी घातली. आणि जवळ जवळ शंभर वर्षानंतर एक यश गवसले. ग्रॅव्हीटेशनल फोर्स, गुरुत्वीय बल, आमच्या वैज्ञानिकांच्या कठोर परिश्रमांमधून त्याचा शोध लागला. हे विज्ञानाचे मोठे यश मानावे लागेल. ज्याचा भविष्यकाळावर परिणाम होणार आहे. गेल्या शतकातील महान शास्त्रज्ञ आईनस्टाईन यांच्या सिध्दांताला या शोधामुळे पुष्टी मिळाली. एवढेच नव्हे तर भौतिक शास्त्राच्या क्षेत्रातला हा एक महान शोध ठरला. साऱ्या मानवसमाजाला , साऱ्या विश्वाला लाभदायक ठरेल अशी गोष्ट आहे. या साऱ्या शोध प्रक्रियेत आमच्या देशातील सुपुत्र, आमच्या देशातील कुशल शास्त्रज्ञ यांचाही वाटा होता याचा भारतीय म्हणून आपल्याला विशेष अभिमान आणि आनंद आहे. या साऱ्या शास्त्रज्ञांना मी हार्दिक शुभेच्छा देतो. त्यांचे अभिनंदन करतो. येत्या काळात या नव्या शोधाला आणखी पुढे नेण्यासाठी आमचे शास्त्रज्ञ प्रयत्न करतील. आंतरराष्ट्रीय पातळीवर होणाऱ्या प्रयत्नांचा भारत एक भाग असेल. आणि माझ्या देशवासियांनो नुकताच यासंदर्भात एक महत्वाचा निर्णय घेतला गेला आहे. या शोधाची पुढची पायरी गाठण्यासाठी लेसर इंटरफेमीटर ग्रॅव्हीटेशनल वेव्ह ऑबझर्व्हेटरी म्हणजेच एलआयजीओ भारतात स्थापन करण्याचा सरकारने निर्णय घेतला आहे. जगात या प्रकारची दोन केंद्रे आहेत, तिसरे भारतात राहील. भारताच्या सहभागामुळे या प्रक्रियेला नवी शक्ती, नवी गति मिळेल.\nमर्यादित साधनसामुग्रीच्या जोरावर भारत मानव कल्याणाच्या या महान वैज्ञानिक शोधात सक्रीय सहभागी होणार आहे. सर्व शास्त्रज्ञांना मी पुन्हा एकदा शुभेच्छा देतो. अभिनंदन करतो.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो एक क्रमांक मी आपल्याला सांगतो, तो टिपून घ्या. या नंबरवर मिस्ड कॉल देऊन तुम्ही उद्यापासून मन की बात ऐकू शकाल. आपल्या मातृभाषेतही ऐकू शकाल. मिस्ड कॉल देण्यासाठी क्रमांक आहे 81908 81908 मी पुन्हा सांगतो 81908 81908. मित्रांनो तुमच्या परीक्षा सुरु होत आहेत, मलाही उद्या परीक्षा दयायची आहे. सव्वाशे कोटी देशवासी माझी परीक्षा घेणार आहेत. ठाऊक आहे ना, उद्या अर्थसंकल्प मांडला जाणार आहे. 29 फेब्रुवारी, लिप वर्ष. पण तुम्ही पाहिलं असेल, माझे बोलणे ऐकल्यावर तुम्हाला वाटेले असेल, की माझी तब्येत ठणठणीत आहे, आत्मविश्वासाने परिपूर्ण आहे. बस, उद्या माझी परीक्षा झाली की परवा तुमची सुरु होईल. आणि आपण सर्व यशस्वी होऊ, तेव्हाच देश यशस्वी होईल. तेव्हा, मित्रहो आपल्याला अनेकानेक शुभेच्छा. यश-अपयश याच्या तणावातून मुक्त होऊन, मुक्त मनाने पुढे जा, ठाम रहा. धन्यवाद.\nS.Tupe/M.Desai\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"

కానీ వాస్తవికమైన, అందుకోగలిగిన లక్ష్యాన్ని స్వయంగా పెట్టుకోండి. ఆ లక్ష్యాన్ని సాధించేందుకు ప్రయత్నం చేయండి. నేను క్రికెట్ ఆడేటప్పుడు నా మీద ఎన్నో అంచనాలు పెట్టుకొనే వారు, నా నుంచి ఎంతో ఆశించే వారు. గత 24 ఏళ్ళలో క్లిష్ట పరిస్థితులు ఎదురయ్యాయి. చాలా సార్లు మంచి క్షణాలు కూడా వచ్చాయి. కానీ, ప్రజల అంచనాలు ఎప్పుడూ పెరుగుతూ పోయాయి. సమయం గడుస్తున్న కొద్దీ అంచనాలు మరింతగా పేరుకుపోసాగాయి. అందుకు దీనికొక పరిష్కారాన్ని కనుక్కోవడం నాకు ఎంతో అవసరం అయింది. దాంతో నేనిదే ఆలోచించాను.. నా అంచనాలను నేనే నిర్ణయించుకుంటాను; లక్ష్యాలను స్వయంగా నిర్దేశించుకుంటానని అనుకున్నాను. నా లక్ష్యాలను నేను స్వయంగా నిర్ణయించుకొని, వాటిని సాధించగలుగుతున్నానంటే దేశానికి నేను ఎంతో కొంత మంచిని చేయగలుగుతున్నాను. ఇంకా ఆ లక్ష్యాలను సాధించేందుకు నేను నిరంతరం ప్రయత్నిస్తూ ఉండే వాడినే. నా దృష్టి బంతి మీద కేంద్రీకృతమైన కొద్దీ నెమ్మది నెమ్మదిగా లక్ష్యాలు నెరవేరాయి. మన ఆలోచనలు సకారాత్మకంగా ఉండటం అత్యవసరం అని నేను మీకు చెప్పదలచుకున్నాను. సానుకూల ఆలోచనలను సానుకూల ఫలితాలు అనుసరిస్తాయి. అందుకే, మీరు తప్పనిసరిగా సానుకూలతతో ఉండండి, ఆ పై వాడు మీకు మంచి ఫలితాలు ప్రసాదిస్తాడని నాకు సంపూర్ణ విశ్వాసం ఉంది. పరీక్షల వేళ మీకందరికీ నా శుభాకాంకాంక్షలు. ఎలాంటి ఒత్తిడికీ లోనవకుండా పరీక్షలు రాయండి. ఇంకా మంచి ఫలితాలు పొందండి. గుడ్ లక్..”\nమిత్రులారా..!\nచూశారా… టెండూల్కర్ గారు ఏం చెప్తున్నారో! ఈ అంచనాల భారాల కింద నలిగిపోకండి. మీ భవిష్యత్తును మీరే నిర్మించుకోవాలి. మీ లక్ష్యాన్ని మీ అంతట మీరే ఏర్పరచుకోండి. స్వచ్ఛమైన మనసుతో, స్వచ్ఛమైన ఆలోచనలతో, స్వచ్ఛమైన సామర్థ్యంతో మీ లక్ష్యానికి చేరే గమ్యాన్ని కూడా మీరే నిర్దేశించుకోండి. సచిన్ గారి ఈ మాటలు మీకు తప్పకుండా ఉపయోగపడతాయని నా నమ్మకం. వేరొకరితో మనకు పోటీ ఎందుకు?. మనతో మనమే పోటీ పడదాము. మరొకరితో పోటీ పడటంలో మన సమయం ఎందుకు వృథా చేసుకోవాలి. మనతో మనమే స్పర్ధ ఎందుకు పెట్టుకోకూడదు. మన రికార్డులను మనమే అధిగమించాలని ఎందుకు ప్రయత్నించకూడదు?. చూడండీ.. మీరు అభివృద్ధి చెందకుండా ఎవరూ ఆపలేరు. పాత రికార్డులను మీరంతట మీరే ఎప్పుడైతే ఛేదిస్తారో, అప్పుడు మీ సంతోషానికి, మీ ఆనందానికి ఎవరూ అడ్డుకట్ట వేయలేరు. ఒక రకమైన సంతోషం లోలోపలి నుంచి వ్యక్తమవుతుంది.\nమిత్రులారా..!\nపరీక్షలు అంటే సంఖ్యలతో ఆట అని భావించకండి. ఎక్కడికి చేరాము, ఎంత దూరం వచ్చాము.. అనేటటువంటి లెక్కా జమల్లో చిక్కుకోకండి. జీవితానికి అంత కంటే ఒక మహోన్నత ఉద్దేశాన్ని నిర్ణయించుకోవాలి. ఒక స్వప్నంతో ప్రయాణించాలి; సంకల్ప బద్ధులు అవ్వాలి. ఈ పరీక్షలు, అవి మనం సవ్యంగా వెళ్తున్నామా లేదా అనే లెక్కలు కడతాయి; మన పరిస్థితి బాగుందా లేదా అని చూస్తాయి. అందుకే ఒక విశాలమైన, ఉన్నతమైన స్వప్నాన్ని ఏర్పరచుకుంటే- పరీక్షలు అనేవి ఒక ఆనందోత్సవంగా మారిపోతుంది. ప్రతి పరీక్ష ఈ మహోన్నత ఉద్దేశం నెరవేరడానికి ఒక ముందడుగు అవుతుంది. ప్రతి విజయం ఆ మహోన్నత లక్ష్యాన్ని సాధించేందుకు తాళం చెవిగా మారుతుంది. అందుకని ఈ సంవత్సరం ఏమవుతుంది.., ఈ పరీక్ష ఏమవుతుంది.. అని అంతవరకే ఆలోచించకండి. ఒక మహోన్నతమైన లక్ష్యాన్ని ఏర్పరచుకొని ముందుకు సాగండి. అలాంటి సమయంలో ఫలితం ఆశించిన స్థాయిలో లభించక పోయినప్పటికీ నిరాశ పడకండి. మరింత బలంగా, మరింత శక్తిమంతంగా పని చేస్తే.. మరి కాస్త గట్టి ప్రయత్నం చేస్తే.. ఫలితం వస్తుంది.\nనా App లో వేలాది మంది మొబైల్ ఫోన్ నుంచి చిన్న చిన్న మాటలు రాశారు. వాటిల్లో ఆరోగ్యకరమైన శరీరంలోనే ఆరోగ్యకరమైన మనసు ఉంటుంది అని శ్రేయ గుప్తా రాసిన మాట ఎన్నదగినది. విద్యార్ధులు తమ చదువుల మీదే కాకుండా ఆరోగ్యం గురించి కూడా శ్రద్ధ తీసుకోవాలి. దానివల్ల పరీక్షను కూడా ఆరోగ్యకరంగా, మంచిగా రాయగలుగుతారు. మీరు దండీలు తీయండి అని, మూడు కిలోమీటర్లు గాని లేదా ఐదు కిలోమీటర్లు గాని పరుగు తీయడానికి వెళ్లండని గాని నేను ఇప్పుడు పరీక్షలకు మరొక్క రోజు మాత్రమే మిగిలి ఉండగా మీకు చెప్పను. కానీ, ఒక్క మాట మాత్రం నిజం.. అదేమిటంటే.. మరీ ముఖ్యంగా పరీక్షల రోజులలో మీ దిన చర్య ఎలా ఉందో చూసుకోండి. ఆ మాటకొస్తే 365 రోజులూ మన దిన చర్య మన కలల, మరియు సంకల్పాల సాధనకు అనువుగా ఉండాలి. శ్రీ ప్రభాకర్ రెడ్డి గారు చెప్పిన ఒక అంశంతో నేను ఏకీభవిస్తాను. ఆయన ప్రత్యేకంగా చేసిన సూచన ఏమిటంటే.. నియమితమైన వేళకు నిద్ర పోవాలి, ఉదయం కాగానే త్వరగా నిద్ర నుంచి లేచి, మననం చేసుకోవాలి అని. పరీక్షా కేంద్రానికి ప్రవేశ పత్రాన్ని, ఇతర వస్తువుల్ని తీసుకొని నిర్ణీత సమయానికన్నా ముందుగానే చేరుకోవాలి. ఈ మాటలనూ ప్రభాకర్ రెడ్డి గారే చెప్పారు. ఈ మాటలను చెప్పడానికి నాకయితే ధైర్యం చాలదేమో!. ఎందుచేతనంటే.. నిద్ర పోయే విషయంలో నేను కాస్తంత ఉదాసీనతను వహిస్తాను. మీరు చాలా తక్కువ సేపే నిద్రపోతారని నా మిత్రులలో చాలా మంది నాతో ఫిర్యాదు చేస్తున్నట్లుగా కూడా అంటూ ఉంటారు మరి. ఇది నాలోని ఒక లోపం; దీనిని సరి చేసుకోవడానికి నేను సైతం ప్రయత్నం చేస్తాను. అయితే, ఈ వాదనతో నేను తప్పక ఏకీభవిస్తున్నాను. తగినంత సేపు నిద్రపోవడం, గాఢమైన నిద్ర.. ఇవి మీరు రోజంతా చేయవల్సిన పనుల కోసం ఎంతో అవసరమైనవే సుమా. నేను అదృష్టవంతుడిని; తక్కువ సేపే నిద్ర పోతాను.. అయితే, నాకు ఆ నిద్ర గాఢంగా పడుతుంది. అందువల్లనే ఆ నిద్ర నాకు సరిపోతున్నది. కానీ మీకు మాత్రం నా మనవి ఏమిటంటే, చాలినంత సేపే నిద్రపొమ్మని. లేదంటే, కొంత మందికి నిద్ర పోయే ముందు చాలా.. చాలా సేపటి వరకు టెలిఫోన్ లో మాట్లాడే అలవాటుంటుంది. ఇక ఆ తరువాత కూడా మెదడులో అవే ఆలోచనలు మెదులుతుంటాయి. అలాంటప్పుడు- నిద్ర ఎలా పడుతుంది?. నేను నిద్ర గురించి చెబుతూ ఉంటే – ఏదో పరీక్షల కోసమే నిద్ర పొమ్మని చెప్తున్నాననుకోకండి. అపార్థం చేసుకోవద్దు. పరీక్షలు రాసే సమయంలో ప్రశ్నలకు చక్కగా జవాబులు రాయడానికి ఎటువంటి ఆందోళన లేకుండా ఉండటానికే మిమ్మల్ని నిద్ర పొమ్మంటున్నాను. అలా నిద్ర పోతూనే ఉండాలని.. నేనేమీ చెప్పటం లేదు. తీరా బాగా నిద్ర పోయి పరీక్షలు రాసి, తక్కువ మార్కులు వచ్చాయంటే- తక్కువ మార్కులు ఎందుకు వచ్చాయి అని అమ్మ అడిగినప్పుడు.. మోదీ గారు పడుకోమని చెప్పారు, నేను పడుకున్నాను.. అని అని చెబుతారా ఏమిటి! అలా చేయరు కద. మీరు అలా చేయరనే నేను నమ్ముతున్నాను.\nఅలాగే, జీవితంలో క్రమశిక్షణ అనేది విజయాల పునాదిరాయిని పటిష్టంగా ఉంచేందుకు మూల కారణంగా నిలుస్తుంది. క్రమశిక్షణతో ఒక బలమైన పునాది పడుతుంది. సువ్యవస్థితంగా ఉండని వారు, క్రమశిక్షణను అలవరచుకోని వారు ఉదయం పూట చేయాల్సిన పనిని సాయంత్రం పూట చేస్తారు; మధ్యాహ్నం పూట చేయాల్సిన పనిని రాత్రి ఎంతో పొద్దు పోయిన తరువాత చేస్తారు.. వారు తాము పనిని పూర్తి చేసేశామనుకుంటారు; కానీ, దీనిలో ఎంత శక్తి వృథా అవుతున్నదో.. ప్రతి క్షణం మానసికంగా ఎంత ఒత్తిడో- తెలుసుకోలేరు. మన శరీరంలో ఏదైనా ఒకటీ అరా అవయవాలకు ఏ కొంచెం ఇబ్బంది ఎదురైనా సరే.. మొత్తం శరీరమే బాగా లేనట్టు అనిపిస్తుందన్నది మీకు అనుభవంలోకి వచ్చే ఉంటుంది. అంతే కాదు, మన దినచర్య కూడా అస్తవ్యస్తం అవుతుంది. కాబట్టి దేన్నీ మనం చిన్న చూపు చూడకూడదు. అందుకని ప్రతిదీ అనుకున్న సమయం లోనే చేసేయాలి; ఇందులో రాజీ పడే అలవాటు చేసుకోవద్దు. నిశ్చయించుకోండి, చేసి చూడండి.\nమిత్రులారా..!\nఅప్పడప్పుడు నేను చూశాను, పరీక్షలకు వెళ్లే విద్యార్ధుల్లో రెండు రకాల వాళ్లు కనిపిస్తారు. వారిలో ఒకటో రకం వారు.. వీరు ఏం చదివారో, ఏం నేర్చుకున్నారో, ఏయే విషయాల్లో వారికి ప్రావీణ్యం ఉందో.. అనే విషయాలపైన మనసును లగ్నం చేస్తారు. రెండో రకం వారు.. ఈ విద్యార్ధులకు పరీక్షలో ఏ ప్రశ్న వస్తుందో తెలియదు, ఏ విధమైన ప్రశ్నలు అడుగుతారో, ఆ ప్రశ్నలకు వారు సమాధానాలు రాయగలరో, లేదో ? ప్రశ్నపత్రం కఠినంగా వస్తుందా లేక తేలిగ్గా ఉంటుందా.. అని ఆలోచిస్తారు. మీరు కూడా ఈ రెండు రకాలైన విద్యార్థుల్ని చూసే ఉంటారు. ప్రశ్నపత్రం ఎలా వస్తుందో అనుకుని ఆందోళనలో ఉండే వారిపైన వారి ఫలితాల విషయంలో కూడా నకారాత్మక ప్రభావమే పడుతుంది. ఎవరైతే నా దగ్గర ఏముంది అనే నమ్మకంతో వెళ్తారో వారు ఏం వచ్చినా దానిని తట్టుకోగలుగుతారు. ఈ విషయాన్ని నా కన్నా బాగా ఎవరు చెప్పగలరు అంటే అది – ప్రపంచంలో చేయి తిరిగిన క్రీడాకారుల ఆట కట్టించిన చదరంగం చాంపియన్ విశ్వనాథన్ ఆనంద్- అంటాను. ఆయన తన అనుభవాలను మీతో పంచుకొంటారు. రండి, ఈ పరీక్షల ఆట కట్టించడం ఎలాగో ఆయన ద్వారానే నేర్చేసుకుందురు గాని..\n“హలో, నేను విశ్వనాథన్ ఆనంద్ ని. ముందుగా, మీరంతా పరీక్షలు బాగా రాయాలని చెప్పి మీకు నా శుభాభినందనలను అందజేయనివ్వండి. ఇక .. నేను నా పరీక్షలకు ఎలా సిద్దమయ్యానో, ఇంకా నా అనుభవాలు ఏమిటో ఇప్పుడు వివరిస్తాను. జీవితంలో ముందుముందు ఎదురయ్యే సమస్యల వంటివే ఈ పరీక్షలు అని నాకనిపించింది. మీరు బాగా విశ్రాంతి తీసుకొని, రాత్రంతా కంటి నిండా కునుకు తీయాలి. అందుకోసం కడుపారా భోంచేయాలి. ఆకలితో మాత్రం ఉండనేకూడదు. అన్నిటి కంటే ముఖ్యమైనది – ప్రశాంతంగా ఉండటం. ఇదంతా చదరంగం క్రీడా పోటీ వంటిదే; మీరు ఆడుతున్నప్పుడు ఏ పావు ఎప్పుడు ఎటు వస్తుందో మీకు తెలియదు. తరగతి గదిలో మీకు తెలియదు కదా.. పరీక్షలో ఏ ప్రశ్న వచ్చేదీ? అలాగే నన్న మాట ఇది కూడా. అందుకని మీరు ప్రశాంతంగా ఉంటే, పౌష్టికాహారం తింటే, చక్కగా నిద్రపోతే- అదుగో అప్పుడే మీ మెదడు సరైన సమాధానాన్ని సరైన సమయంలో గుర్తు చేసుకోగలుగుతుంది. కాబట్టి ప్రశాంతంగా ఉండండి. మీ మీద ఎక్కువ ఒత్తిడి లేకుండా చూసుకోవటం అనేది ఎంతో కీలకమైన అంశం. మీ మీద అంచనాలను కూడా మరీ ఎక్కువగా పెట్టుకోకండి. కేవలం ఒక సవాలుగా దాన్ని చూడండి- సంవత్సరం అంతా నేర్పించింది గుర్తు చేసుకోగలనా? ఈ సమస్యలను పరిష్కరించగలనా? – అని. చివరి నిమిషంలో చాలా ముఖ్యమైన అంశాలను, ఇంకా మీకు ముఖ్యమైనవిగా అనిపించిన అంశాలను, మీకు బాగా గుర్తు లేని అంశాలను మరోసారి చూసుకోండి. మీ తోటి విద్యార్థుల తోనో, లేక మీ ఉపాధ్యాయుల తోనో జరిగిన కొన్ని ఘటనలను కూడా మీరు పరీక్ష రాసే సమయంలో జ్ఞాపకానికి తెచ్చుకోవచ్చు; దీనివల్ల మీకు ఆ పాఠానికి సంబంధించిన ఎంతో సమాచారం గుర్తుకొస్తుంది. మీకు కష్టంగా అనిపించిన ప్రశ్నలను, పాఠాలను పునశ్చరణ చేశారంటే- అవి మీ మెదడులో తాజా అయిపోతాయి. దీంతో పరీక్ష రాసే సమయంలో వాటిని మరింత మెరుగ్గా రాయగలుగుతారు. అందుకే ప్రశాంతంగా ఉండండి; బాగా నిద్రపోండి. మితిమీరిన ఆత్మవిశ్వాసానికి పోకండి; న్యూనత భావాన్ని కూడా దరిజేరనీయవద్దు. నా అనుభవం ఏమిటంటే – ముందు భయపడిన దాని కంటే పరీక్షలు ఎంతో మెరుగ్గా గడచిపోతాయి. ధైర్యంగా ఉండండి.. మీకు అంతా మంచే జరగాలి గాక.”\nవిశ్వనాథన్ ఆనంద్ నిజంగా గొప్ప మాట చెప్పారు. ఆయన ఆడే అంతర్జాతీయ చదరంగం పోటీల్లో ఎంత స్వస్థతతో కూర్చుంటారో, ఎంత ఏకాగ్రంగా ఉంటారో మీరు పరిశీలించే ఉంటారు. ఆయన కళ్లు అటూ ఇటూ తిరగవు; ఇది కూడా మీరు గమనించే ఉంటారు. అర్జునుడు దృష్టి పక్షి కంటి మీద నిలిచేదని విన్నాం కదా.. అలాగన్నమాట. సరిగ్గా విశ్వనాథన్ ఆనంద్ కూడా ఆట ఆడుతున్నప్పుడు- ఆయన దృష్టంతా పెద్ద లక్ష్యం మీద కేంద్రీకృతమై ఉంటుంది. ఆయన మనసు లోని ప్రశాంతత ఆ కళ్లలో ప్రతిఫలిస్తుంటుంది. ఎవరైనా చెప్పారని, లోపలి శాంతి బయటికి కనిపిస్తుందా అంటే చెప్పడం కష్టమే. కానీ, ప్రయత్నం చేయాలి. దీనిని నవ్వుతూ నవ్వుతూ ఎందుకు చేయలేం? మీరు నవ్వుతూ ఉండండి. పరీక్షలు రాసేటప్పుడు కూడా ఆడుతూ పాడుతూ, నవ్వుతూ ఉంటే శక్తి తనంతట తాను ప్రశాంతంగా వెలికి వస్తుంది. మీరు స్నేహితులతో మాట్లాడటం లేదు; లేదా, ఒంటరిగా నడుస్తున్నారు.. ఒక్కొక్క అడుగే వేస్తున్నారు; చివరి క్షణం వరకు అలాగే పుస్తకాలను, పేజీలను తిరగేస్తున్నారనుకోండి. అలా చేస్తే మనసు ప్రశాంతంగా ఉండజాలదు. నవ్వండి.. బాగా నవ్వూతూ సాగండి. తోటి వారితో కలసి ఛలోక్తులు విసరుతూ సాగండి. అప్పుడు చూడండి – శాంతియుతమైన వాతావరణం దానంతట అదే వెలస్తుంది.\nనేను మీకు ఒక చిన్న మాటను అర్థమయ్యేలా చెప్పాలనుకుంటున్నాను. మీరు ఒక చెరువు ఒడ్డున నిలబడి ఉన్నారనుకోండి. కింద నీటిలో చాలా వస్తువులు కనపడతాయి. కానీ అకస్మాత్తుగా ఆ నీటిలో ఎవరైనా ఒక రాయిని రువ్వారనుకోండి.. నీరు కదలడం మొదలైపోతుంది. అంతకు ముందు ఏమీ లేనప్పుడు కనిపించినట్టుగా రాయి వేసిన తరువాత కనిపిస్తాయా? నీరు కుదురుగా ఉంటే, అందులో అడుగున వస్తువులు కూడా కనిపిస్తాయి. నీరు చెదరిపోతే, అందులోనివి ఏవీ కనపడవు. మీ లోపల కూడా అలా ఎంతో పడి ఉంది; ఏడాది పాటు పడిన శ్రమ తాలూకు భాండాగారం లోపల నిండిపోయి ఉంటుంది. కానీ మనస్సు అశాంతిగా ఉంటే, ఆ ఖజానాను మీరు వెతుక్కోలేరు. అదే.. మనసు ప్రశాంతంగా ఉందనుకోండి.. మీ మనసులోని ఆ ఖజానా వెలికి వచ్చి మీ ముందు నిలుస్తుంది. మీ పరీక్ష అమాంతం సరళంగా మారిపోతుంది.\nనేను ఒక విషయాన్ని వెల్లడించనా.. అది నా స్వవిషయమే. నేను ఎప్పుడైనా ఏదైనా ఉపన్యాసం వినడానికి వెళ్తాను, లేదా ప్రభుత్వంలో కూడా కొన్ని విషయాలు నాకు తెలియనివి ఉండవచ్చు. అలాంటి వాటిపైన నేను ఎంతో దృష్టిని కేంద్రీకరించవలసి వస్తుంది. అప్పుడప్పుడు లోతైన పరిశీలన ద్వారా అర్థం చేసుకునేందుకు ప్రయత్నిస్తుంటాను. అటువంటప్పుడు మనసు లోపల ఒత్తిడి బయలుదేరుతుంది. మళ్లీ నాకనిపిస్తుంది.. లేదు లేదు.. కొద్దిగా సేద తీరుదామని; అలా చేస్తే – అప్పుడు బాగుంటుందనిపిస్తుంది. ఇందుకోసం నాలో నేనే ఒక పద్ధతిని రూపొందించుకున్నాను. బాగా దీర్ఘంగా ఊపిరి పీల్చుకుంటాను. మూడు సార్లు గాని, అయిదు సార్లు గాని- గట్టిగా ఊపిరిని పీల్చుకొని వదులుతాను. దీనికి 30, 40, 50 సెకండ్లు పడుతుంది. కానీ, ఒక్కసారిగా నా మనసు ప్రశాంతమై, విషయాలను అర్థం చేసుకోవడానికి సిద్ధపడుతుంది. ఇది నా అనుభవమే కావచ్చు; మీకు కూడా ఉపయోగపడేదే.\nరజత్ అగర్వాల్ ఒక మంచి మాట చెప్పారు.. ఆయన నా App లో ఇలా రాశారు – మేము ప్రతి రోజు కనీసం అర గంట స్నేహితులతో, కుటుంబ సభ్యులతో ప్రశాంతంగా మాట్లాడి సేద తీరుతాం. పిచ్చాపాటి మాట్లాడతాం, గప్పాలు కొడతాం. రజత్ జీ చాలా గొప్ప మాట చెప్పారు. ఎందుకంటే చాలా వరకు మనం చూస్తాము.. పరీక్షలు రాసి ఇంటికి రాగానే, లెక్క పెట్టుకుంటూ కూర్చుంటాం.. ఎన్ని సరిగ్గా రాశాము. ఎన్ని తప్పులు రాశాము.. అని. ఇంట్లో కూడా తల్లితండ్రులు చదువుకున్న వారైతే, వారు కూడా ఉపాధ్యాయులైతే.. నువ్వు పరీక్ష ఎలా రాశావు?, ఏమేం ప్రశ్నలు వచ్చాయి అంటూ మళ్లీ పరీక్షను పూర్తిగా రాయిస్తారు; లేదా, ఏం జవాబులు రాశావో చెప్పమంటారు. 40 మార్కులు వస్తాయా?, 80 మార్కులు వస్తాయా?, 90 మార్కులు వస్తాయా? అని అడుగుతారు. అప్పుడు మీ మెదడంతా వేడెక్కుతుంది. మీరైనా ఏం చేస్తారు.. ఫోన్లలో స్నేహితులతో ఈ విషయాలు మాట్లాడతారు. ‘అరె యార్! అందులో నువ్వు ఏమి రాశావు?. ఏయే ప్రశ్నలకు జవాబులు రాశావు, నీకేమనిపిస్తోంది’ అంటారు. మీ మిత్రులేమో – నేనంతా గందరగోళంలో పడిపోయాను. తప్పు చేశాననిపించింది; నాకు జవాబు తెలిసి కూడా, ఆ సమయానికి జ్ఞాపకం రాలేదు.. అంటారు. ఇట్లా, ఇందులోనే పడి కొట్టుకుంటాము. మిత్రులారా! మీరిలా చేయకండి. పరీక్ష సమయం ముగిసింది. అయిపోయిందేదో అయిపోయింది. కుటుంబ సభ్యులతో గప్పాలు కొట్టండి. పాత హాస్యపు ముచ్చట్లు మరో సారి చెప్పుకోండి. ఎప్పుడైనా అమ్మానాన్నలతో ఎక్కడికైనా వెళ్లి ఉంటే, అదుగో అప్పటి సంగతులను నెమరు వేసుకోండి. పూర్తిగా వాటి నుంచి బయటపడి అరగంట గడపండి. రజత్ జీ మాటలు నిజంగా అర్థం చేసుకోదగినవిగా ఉన్నాయి.\nమిత్రులారా..!\nనేను మీకు శాంతి గురించి ఓ మాట చెప్పనా? ఈ రోజు మీరు పరీక్ష రాయడానికి ముందు ఎటువంటి వ్యక్తి మీకొక సందేశం పంపారంటే.. ఆయన మౌలికంగా ఒక అధ్యాపకుడు; ఇప్పుడు ఒక రకమైన సంస్కార ప్రబోధకునిగా మారారు. రాంచరిత్ మానస్ ను ప్రస్తుత పరిస్థితులకు అన్వయించి, దాని గురించి వ్యాఖ్యానం చేస్తూ దేశం లోపలా, దేశం బయటా ప్రపంచం అంతటికీ ఆ సంస్కార ప్రవాహాన్ని చేరవేసే ప్రయత్నాలలో ఉన్నారు. అటువంటి పూజ్య మురారీ బాపూ సైతం విద్యార్థుల కోసం ఒక మహత్వపూర్ణమైన చిట్కాను పంపించారు. ఆయన ఒక బోధకుడు , ఆలోచనాపరుడు కూడా, అందుచేత ఆయన మాటల్లో రెండింటి సమ్మేళనం ఉంటుంది.\n“నేను.. మురారీ బాపూను.. మాట్లాడుతున్నాను. విద్యార్థి సోదర సోదరీమణులకు నేను చెప్పదలచుకుంటున్నది ఏమిటంటే.. పరీక్షల సమయంలో మనసు మీద ఎటువంటి భారాన్నీపెట్టుకోకండి. స్పష్టమైన నిర్ణయాన్నితీసుకుని, మీరు పరీక్ష రాయడానికి కూర్చోండి. ఎటువంటి పరిస్థితి వచ్చినా, దానిని స్వీకరించండి. పరిస్థితిని ఉన్నది ఉన్నట్టుగా స్వీకరించినట్లయితే, మనం ప్రశాంతంగా ఉండగలుగుతాం. సంతోషంగా ఉండగలుగుతాము అనేది నా అనుభవం. మీ పరీక్షలో మీరు ఎటువంటి ఒత్తిడి లేకుండా ప్రశాంత చిత్తంతో ముందుకు సాగినట్లయితే తప్పక సఫలులవుతారు. ఒకవేళ ఉత్తీర్ణత లభించకపోయినా, పరీక్ష తప్పామన్న దిగులు ఉండదు; సఫలమయ్యామని గర్వంగా కూడా ఉంటుంది. ఒక కవిత చెప్పి నేను నా సందేశాన్ని, శుభాకాంక్షలనూ అందజేస్తాను – అది\n“ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ కృతకృత్యులే కావాలని నియమం ఏమీ లేదు;\nవైఫల్యాలతో కూడా కలసి జీవించడం నేర్చుకోండి”.\nగౌరవనీయులైన మన ప్రధాన మంత్రి గారి ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’ కార్యక్రమం విలువైనదిగా భావిస్తున్నాను. అందరికీ మరీ మరీ నా శుభాకాంక్షలు తెలియజేస్తున్నాను, ధన్యవాదాలు.\nపూజ్య మురారీ బాపు మనందరికీ చాలా మంచి సందేశం ఇచ్చినందుకు ఆయనకు నేను కూడా కృతజ్ఞుడను.\nమిత్రులారా..!\nఇవాళ నేను మరో మాట చెప్పాలనుకుంటున్నాను. నేను ఒక విషయం గమనిస్తున్నాను. ఈ సారి ప్రజలు తమ అనుభవాలను చెప్పినపుడు వాటిలో యోగా గురించిన ప్రస్తావన తప్పకుండా తీసుకువచ్చారు. ఈ రోజుల్లో ప్రపంచంలో నేను ఎవరిని కలసినా సరే, కొంచెం సమయం దొరికినా చాలు యోగా గురించి కొద్దిగా అయినా ఎవరో ఒకరు మాట్లాడుతూనే ఉంటారు; ఇది నాకు ఎంతో సంతోషం కలిగించే విషయం. ప్రపంచంలో ఏ దేశానికి చెందిన వ్యక్తి అయినా కానివ్వండి; భారత్ కి చెందిన వ్యక్తే అయినా కానివ్వండి – యోగా గురించి ఇంతటి ఆకర్షణ ఏర్పడింది; ఇంతటి జిజ్ఞాస పుట్టుకువచ్చింది. ఇది నాకు చాలా బాగా అనిపిస్తోంది. నా మొబైల్ App నకు ఎంతో మంది – శ్రీ అతను మండల్, శ్రీ కుణాల్ గుప్తా, శ్రీ సుశాంత్ కుమార్, శ్రీ కె.జి. ఆనంద్, శ్రీ అభిజీత్ కులకర్ణి – ఇలా లెక్కలేనంత మంది మెడిటేషన్ గురించి ప్రస్తావించారు. యోగా ప్రాధాన్యం గురించి మాట్లాడారు. సరే, మిత్రులారా! నేను ఇప్పుడే ఇవాళే చెప్పాను అనుకోండి, రేపు పొద్దుటి నుంచి యోగా చేయడం మొదలు పెట్టండి అని – అది మీ పట్ల అన్యాయం చేయడమే అవుతుంది. కానీ, ఇప్పటికే యోగా ఎవరైతే చేస్తున్నారో వాళ్ళు పరీక్ష ఉంది, ఇవాళ చేయవద్దులే అనుకోవద్దు; అలా చేయవద్దు. చేస్తున్నారంటే.. చేయండి. కానీ, ఈ మాట మాత్రం నిజం. విద్యార్థి జీవితంలో కానివ్వండి, లేదా ఆ తదనంతర జీవితంలో కానివ్వండి.. మనో వికాస యాత్రలో యోగా ఒక మంచి పరిష్కారం. చాలా తేలికైన పరిష్కారం. మీరు తప్పక దానిపై దృష్టి సారించండి. ఆ.. మీ దగ్గర్లో ఎవరైనా యోగా తెలిసిన వారు ఉన్నట్లయితే వారిని అడగండి. అంతకు ముందు యోగా చేయకపోయినప్పటికీ పరీక్షల రోజుల్లో – రెండు, మూడు విషయాలు చెప్తారు, మీరు వాటిని రెండు నాలుగైదు నిమిషాల్లో చేయగలుగుతారు. చూడండి, వాటిని మీరు చేయగలరేమో. అవును, దాని మీద నాకు బాగా నమ్మకం ఉంది.\nనా యువజన సహచరులారా! పరీక్ష హాలులోకి వెళ్ళాలని మీకు చాలా తొందరగా ఉంటుంది. త్వరత్వరగా మీ బల్ల మీద వెళ్ళి కూర్చోవాలని అనిపిస్తూ ఉంటుంది. ఈ విషయాలన్నీ హడావుడిగా ఎందుకు చేస్తారు? మీ మొత్తం రోజులోని సమయానికి ప్రణాళిక ముందుగానే ఎందుకు సిద్ధం చేయరు..? అంటే ట్రాఫిక్ లో చిక్కుకుపోయినా సరే, సమయానికన్న ముందుగానే గమ్యాన్ని చేరగలిగేటట్లుగా ప్రణాళికను ఎందుకు వేసుకోరు. అలా వేసుకోలేదంటే గనక ఇటువంటి విషయాలు ఒక కొత్త ఒత్తిడిని సృష్టిస్తాయి. ఇంకొక మాట – మనకు ఎంత సమయం దొరికిందో ఆ సమయంలో ప్రశ్నపత్రం, సూచనలు ఏవైతే ఉన్నాయో వాటన్నిటికి సమయం వృథా అవుతుంది కదా- మన సమయాన్ని ఇవి మింగేస్తాయి కదా- ఇలాగని అప్పుడప్పడూ అనిపిస్తుంది. కానీ, అలాంటిదేమీ లేదు. మిత్రులారా! ఆ సూచనలను మీరు జాగ్రత్తగా క్షుణ్ణంగా చదవండి. రెండు నిమిషాలు, మూడు నిమిషాలు, ఐదు నిమిషాలు పోతే పోతాయి. అంతే కదా! పెద్ద నష్టమేమీ జరగదు. కానీ దాని వల్ల పరీక్షలో ఏం చేయాలి అనేది తెలుస్తుంది. ఎటువంటి అయోమయం ఉండదు, తరువాత పశ్చాత్తాపం కలగదు. ఇంకా, నేను చాలా సార్లు చూశాను.. పరీక్ష పేపరు వచ్చిన తరువాతనే పద్ధతి కొత్తగా ఉందనిపిస్తుంది. కానీ, సూచనలు చదివిన తరువాత బహుశా అందుకు తగినట్టుగా మనకు మనం సిద్ధమవుతాం. ఆ.. ఫర్వా లేదు; నేను ఇలాగే రాయాలి అని. మీకు నేను విన్నవిస్తున్నాను.. ఒక్క అయిదు నిమిషాలు ఇందులో పోతే పోనీయండి కానీ, ఇది మాత్రం తప్పక చేయండి.\nశ్రీ యశ్ నాగర్ నా మొబైల్ App నకు ఇలా రాశారు – ఆయన మొదటి సారి ప్రశ్నపత్రాన్ని చదివినప్పుడు అది చాలా కష్టంగా ఉన్నట్టు అనిపించిందిట. కానీ, అదే పేపరును రెండో సారి ఆత్మ విశ్వాసంతో చదివితే ఇప్పుడు ఈ ప్రశ్నా పత్రమే నా దగ్గర ఉంది.. కొత్త ప్రశ్నలేవీ వచ్చేది లేదు. ఇన్ని ప్రశ్నలు మాత్రమే నేను రాయాలి అని. ఆయన ఏం రాశారంటే, రెండో సారి నేను ఆలోచించడం మొదలు పెడితే – నాకు ఎంతో తేలిగ్గా పేపరు అర్థమయింది అని. మొదటి సారి చదివినప్పుడు నాకు రాదు అని అనిపించింది. కానీ, అదే పేపరును రెండో మారు చదివితే – కాదు.. కాదు; అదే ప్రశ్నను వేరే పద్ధతిలో పెట్టారు, కానీ విషయం మాత్రం అదే, నాకు తెలిసినదే.. అని అర్థమైంది అని. అంటే ఇక్కడ ప్రశ్నలను గ్రహించడం అనేది చాలా ముఖ్యావవసరం. ప్రశ్న తీరును అర్థం చేసుకోకపోతే అప్పుడప్పుడు ప్రశ్న కఠినంగా ఉన్నట్టు అనిపిస్తుంది. మీరు ప్రశ్నలను రెండు సార్లు చదవండి, మూడు సార్లు చదవండి, నాలుగు సార్లు చదవండి.. మీకు తెలిసిన దానితో దానిని సరిచూసుకునే ప్రయత్నం చేయండి – అని యశ్ నాగర్ చెప్పిన మాటలను నేను సమర్థిస్తున్నాను. మీరు చూడండి, దీనివల్ల రాయటానికి ముందే ప్రశ్న తేలికయిపోతుంది.\nనాకు ఈ రోజు చాలా సంతోషం కలిగించే విషయం ఏమిటంటే – ‘భారత రత్న’ – మన ప్రముఖ శాస్త్రవేత్త సి.ఎన్.ఆర్. రావు – ధైర్యాన్ని గురించి నొక్కి చెప్పారు. అతి కొద్ది పదాలలోనే; కానీ మన విద్యార్థులందరికీ ఆయన మంచి సందేశాన్ని ఇచ్చారు. రండి – రావు గారి సందేశం విందాం…\n“నేను.. బెంగళూరు నుంచి సి.ఎన్.ఆర్.రావు ను. పరీక్షలు ఉత్కంఠ కలిగిస్తాయని నేను పూర్తిగా అర్థం చేసుకుంటాను. అందునా పోటీ పరీక్షలు. ఆందోళన పడకండి, మీ శక్తి వంచన లేకుండా పని చేయండి. నా యువ మిత్రులందరికీ నేను చెప్పేది అదే. అదే సమయంలో, ఒక విషయం గుర్తు పెట్టుకోండి – ఈ దేశంలో చాలా అవకాశాలు ఉన్నాయి. జీవితంలో మీరు ఏం చేయాలనుకుంటున్నారో నిర్ణయించుకోండి, ఎప్పటికీ పట్టు వీడకండి. మీరు గెలుస్తారు. మీరు ఈ విశ్వ మాత పిల్లలన్న సంగతి మరచిపోవద్దు. చెట్లూ – పర్వతాల మాదిరి గానే మీకు కూడా ఇక్కడ ఉండే హక్కు ఉంది. మీకు కావలసిందల్లా పట్టుదల, అంకిత భావం, సాధన. ఈ లక్షణాలతో మీరు అన్ని పరీక్షలలోనూ ఉత్తీర్ణులవుతారు. అన్ని ఇతర ప్రయత్నాలలో గెలుస్తారు. మీరు చేయాలనుకునే ప్రతి విషయంలో విజయం సాధించాలని ఆశిస్తున్నాను. దైవం మిమ్మల్ని ఆశీర్వదించుగాక.”\nచూశారా, ఒక గొప్ప శాస్త్రవేత్త మాట్లాడే తీరు ఎలా ఉంటుందో! ఏ మాట చెప్పడానికి నేను అర గంట సమయం తీసుకుంటానో, ఆ మాటను వాళ్ళు మూడు నిమిషాల్లో చెప్పేస్తారు. ఇదే విజ్ఞాన శాస్త్రానికి ఉండే బలం. ఇదే శాస్త్రవేత్త మనసుకు ఉండే బలం. దేశంలోని పిల్లలకు స్ఫూర్తిని ఇచ్చినందుకు రావు గారికి కృతజ్ఞతలు తెలియజేస్తున్నాను. దృఢత్వం, నిష్ఠ, సాధన ల గురించి ఆయన చెప్పిన మాటలు ఇవే – అంకిత భావం, దృఢ నిశ్చయం, శ్రద్ధ – దృఢంగా ఉండండి మిత్రులారా! దృఢంగా ఉండండి. మీరు దృఢంగా ఉంటే భయం కూడా భయపడుతూ ఉంటుంది. ఇంకా, మంచి చేయడానికి బంగారు భవిష్యత్తు మీ కోసం ఎదురు చూస్తోంది.\nఇప్పుడు నా App పైన రుచిక డాబస్ నుంచి ఒక సందేశం – తన పరీక్షల అనుభవాన్ని రుచిక పంచుకున్నారు. పరీక్షల సమయంలో తన కుటుంబ సభ్యులు అందరూ ఒక సానుకూల వాతావరణం ఉండేలా నిరంతర ప్రయత్నం చేస్తూ ఉంటారనీ, ఇదే విధమైన కసరత్తు తమ తోటి కుటుంబాల్లో కూడా జరుగుతుందనీ చెప్పారు. మొత్తంమీద సానుకూలమైన వాతావరణం అన్న మాట. ఈ మాట సరైనదే. సచిన్ జీ కూడా చెప్పినట్టు.. సానుకూల ధోరణి, సానుకూల మనో దృక్పథం- ఇవి సానుకూల శక్తిని తయారు చేస్తాయి.\nఅప్పుడప్పుడు చాలా మాటలు ఎలా ఉంటాయంటే, మనకు ప్రేరణనిచ్చే బోలెడు మాటలు – విద్యార్థులకు మాత్రమే ప్రేరణనిస్తాయని అనుకోవద్దు. జీవితంలో ఎటువంటి దశలో మీరు ఉన్నప్పటికీ, ఒక మంచి ఉదాహరణ, నిజ జీవిత ఘట్టాలు.. ఇవి అధిక ప్రేరణనిస్తాయి; చాలా బలాన్ని కూడా ఇస్తాయి. క్లిష్ట సమయంలో నూతన మార్గాలను చూపుతాయి. మనందరం విద్యుత్తు బల్బు ను ఆవిష్కరించిన థామస్ ఎల్వా ఎడిసన్ ను గురించి మన పాఠాల్లో చదువుకుంటాం. కానీ మిత్రులారా, ఎప్పుడైనా ఈ విషయం ఆలోచించారా.. ఈ పని చేయడానికి ఆయన ఎన్ని సంవత్సరాలు వెచ్చించారో. ఆయనకు ఎన్నిసార్లు వైఫల్యాలు ఎదురయ్యాయో! ఎంత సమయం పట్టిందో. ఎంత డబ్బు ఖర్చయిందో, వైఫల్యాలతో ఎంతగా నిరాశ చెంది వుండవచ్చో. కానీ, ఈ రోజు ఆ విద్యుత్తే, ఆ బల్బే.. మన జీవితాల్లో కూడా వెలుగులు నింపుతున్నాయి. అందుకే అంటారు.. వైఫల్యాల్లో కూడా విజయాలు దాగి ఉంటాయని.\nశ్రీనివాస రామానుజన్ అంటే తెలియని వారు ఎవరు? ఆధునిక కాలంలో మహోన్నత గణిత శాస్త్రవేత్తలలో ఒక పేరున్న భారత గణిత శాస్త్రవేత్త ఆయన. మీకు తెలిసే ఉంటుంది, గణితంలో ఎటువంటి సంప్రదాయ విద్యను ఆయన అభ్యసించలేదు. ప్రత్యేక శిక్షణ అయినా తీసుకోలేదు. కానీ ఆయన గణిత విశ్లేషణ, సంఖ్యా సిద్ధాంతం వంటి విభిన్న రంగాలలో అమూల్యమైన సేవలు అందించారు. అత్యంత కష్టమైన జీవితాన్ని, దుఃఖ భరితమైన జీవితాన్ని గడిపినప్పటికీ ప్రపంచానికి ఆయన ఎంతో ఇచ్చి వెళ్ళారు.\nవిజయం అనేది ఎప్పుడైనా, ఎవరినైనా వరించవచ్చుననటానికి మంచి ఉదాహరణ జె.కె. రాలింగ్. హారీ పోటర్ సిరీస్ ఈనాడు ప్రపంచమంతటా మారుమోగుతోంది. కానీ మొదటి నుంచి ఇలా లేదు. ఆమె ఎన్నో సమస్యలకు ఎదురీదవలసి వచ్చిందని, ఎన్ని వైఫల్యాలో వచ్చాయని, ఇన్ని కష్టాల్లో కూడా తాను దైవంగా భావించే ఆ పనిలోనే తన శక్తినంతా ధారపోశానని రాలింగ్ స్వయంగా చెప్పారు.\nపరీక్షలు ఈ మధ్య విద్యార్థులకు ఒక్కరికే కాదు, మొత్తం కుటుంబానికీ, పాఠశాలకూ, ఉపాధ్యాయులకూ.. అందరికీ పరీక్షలు అవుతాయి. కానీ, తల్లితండ్రులు, ఉపాధ్యాయుల మద్దతు లేకుండా ఒంటరి విద్యార్థి పరిస్థితి బావుండదు. టీచరో, తల్లిదండ్రులో, సీనియర్ విద్యార్థులో.. వీరంతా కలసి ఒక జట్టుగా ఏర్పడి, ఒకే విధంగా ఆలోచిస్తూ వ్యూహాత్మకంగా ముందడుగు వేస్తే, పరీక్ష సులువై పోతుంది.\nశ్రీ కేశవ్ వైష్ణవ్ నాకు App లో రాశారు. ఆయన ఫిర్యాదు చేశారు. ఏమనంటే, ఎక్కువ మార్కుల కోసం తల్లితండ్రులు తమ పిల్లల మీద ఎప్పుడూ ఒత్తిడి తీసుకురాకూడదని. పరీక్షలకు సిద్ధం కావటానికి మాత్రం ప్రోత్సహించాలి. వాళ్ళు విశ్రాంతిగా ఉండేలా చూడాలి.\nపిల్లల మీద తమ ఆశల బరువును మోపవద్దని విజయ్ జిందల్ రాశారు. ఎంత వీలైతే అంతగా వారికి ధైర్యం చెప్పాలి. విశ్వాసం నిలుపుకొనేందుకు సహాయం చేయాలి. అది నిజమే. ఈ రోజు తల్లితండ్రులకు ఎక్కువగా చెప్పాలనుకోవడం లేదు. దయచేసి పిల్లలను ఒత్తిడిలో పడేయకండి. ఒకవేళ ఎవరైనా స్నేహితునితో మాట్లాడుతుంటే – వారించకండి. ఒక తేలికపాటి వాతావరణాన్ని – సకారాత్మక వాతావరణాన్ని నెలకొల్పండి. చూడండి.. మీ అబ్బాయి లేదా మీ అమ్మాయిలో ఎంత నమ్మకం వస్తుందో. మీకు కూడా ఆ విశ్వాసం కనిపిస్తుంది.\nమిత్రులారా…!\nఒకటి మాత్రం తథ్యం. ముఖ్యంగా యువ మిత్రులతో చెప్పాలనుకుంటున్నాను. మన జీవితం మన పూర్వ తరాల కంటే ఎంతో మారిపోయింది. ప్రతి క్షణం కొత్త ఆవిష్కారం, కొత్త పరిజ్ఞానం, విజ్ఞానం నిత్య నూతన రూపాన్ని సంతరించుకుంటోంది. ఇంకా.. మనం కేవలం నిష్ఫలం అయిపోతున్నామనే భావన. కానీ, అది కాదు.. దానితో జత కలవటానికి మనం ఇష్టపడతాం. మనం కూడా విజ్ఞానం వేగాన్ని మించి, ముందుకు దూసుకుపోవాలని కోరుకుంటాం.\nనేనీమాట ఎందుకు చెప్తున్నానంటే, మిత్రులారా, ఈరోజు జాతీయ విజ్ఞాన దినోత్సవం. దేశ విజ్ఞాన మహోత్సవాన్ని ఏటా ఫిబ్రవరి 28న జాతీయ విజ్ఞాన దినోత్సవంగా పాటిస్తాం. 1928 ఫిబ్రవరి 28 – సర్ సి.వి.రామన్ తన పరిశోధన – ‘రామన్ ఎఫెక్ట్’ను ప్రకటించారు. అదే పరిశోధనకు ఆయనకు నోబెల్ పురస్కారం లభించింది. అందుకే దేశం ఫిబ్రవరి 28న నేషనల్ సైన్స్ డే రూపంలో జరుపుకొంటోంది. జిజ్ఞాస – విజ్ఞానానికి మాత. ప్రతి ఒక్కరి మనసులో వైజ్ఞానిక సంబంధమైన ఆలోచనలు ఉండాలి. విజ్ఞానం పట్ల ఆకర్షణ ఉండాలి. ప్రతి తరం ఆవిష్కారాల పైన దృష్టి పెట్టాలి. విజ్ఞానం, టెక్నాలజీ లేకుండా- ఆవిష్కారం సంభవం కాదు.\nఈ రోజు నేషనల్ సైన్స్ డే సందర్భంగా దేశంలో ఆవిష్కారాలకు బలం చేకూరింది. జ్ఞానం, విజ్ఞానం, సాంకేతికత, ఇవన్నీ మన వికాస యాత్రలో సహజంగా భాగం కావాలి. ఇంకా, ఈ సారి నేషనల్ సైన్స్ డే ఇతివృత్తం ‘మేక్ ఇన్ ఇండియా.. సైన్స్ – టెక్నాలజీ ఆధారిత ఆవిష్కరణలు.’\nసర్ సి.వి.రామన్ కు శిరసు వంచి నమస్కరిస్తున్నాను. విజ్ఞానం పట్ల ఆసక్తిని పెంచుకోవలసిందిగా మీకు అందరికీ విజ్ఞప్తి చేస్తున్నాను.\nమిత్రులారా..!\nఅప్పుడప్పుడూ విజయాలు చాలా ఆలస్యంగా వస్తాయి. విజయం ఎప్పుడైతే వరిస్తుందో – అప్పుడు ప్రపంచాన్ని చూసే దృష్టి కూడా మారిపోతుంది. పరీక్షల్లో మీరు బహుశా తీరిక లేకుండా ఉండవచ్చు. అందుకే చాలా వార్తలు మీ మనసులో నమోదు కాకపోవచ్చు. కానీ ఈ మాటను నేను దేశ ప్రజలందరికీ మరో సారి చెప్పాలనుకుంటున్నాను. కొద్ది రోజుల క్రితం విని ఉంటారు. విజ్ఞాన ప్రపంచంలో ఒక పెద్ద… ముఖ్యమైన పరిశోధన జరిగింది. ప్రపంచ శాస్త్రవేత్తలు ఎంతో కష్టపడ్డారు. తరాలు వచ్చిపోయాయి. ఎంతో కొంత చేస్తూ పోయాయి. ఇంకా సుమారు వందేళ్ళ తరువాత ఒక విజయం చేతికందింది. గురుత్వాకర్షణ తరంగాలను (Gravitational Waves)మన శాస్త్రవేత్తలు తీవ్ర కృషితో గుర్తించారు. విజ్ఞాన రంగంలో ఇదొక సుదూర ప్రయాణం అనంతరం లభించిన ఫలితం. గత శతాబ్దికి చెందిన ప్రముఖ శాస్త్రవేత్త ఐన్ స్టీన్ సిద్ధాంతాన్ని ఈ పరిశోధన ప్రామాణీకరించటంతో పాటు భౌతిక శాస్త్రంలో గొప్ప ఆవిష్కారంగా కూడా గుర్తింపు పొందింది. మానవ జాతి అంతటికీ, విశ్వమంతటికీ ప్రయోజనం చేకూర్చే అంశం ఇది. ఈ పరిశోధన ప్రక్రియలో మన దేశ ముద్దు బిడ్డలు, మన మేధావి శాస్త్రవేత్తలు కూడా పాల్గొనడం, వారికీ ఇందులో భాగస్వామ్యం ఉండటం భారతీయులుగా మనకందరికీ ఆనందదాయకం.\nనేను ఆ శాస్త్రవేత్తలందరికీ హార్దిక శుభాకాంక్షలు తెలియ జేయాలనుకుంటున్నాను; అభినందనలు తెలియజేయాలనుకుంటున్నాను. భవిష్యత్తులో కూడా ఈ పరిశోధనను ముందుకు తీసుకువెళ్ళడంలో మన శాస్త్రవేత్తలు కృషి ని కొనసాగిస్తారు. అంతర్జాతీయ స్థాయిలో జరిగే కృషిలో భారతదేశం కూడా భాగస్వామి అవుతుంది. నా దేశ వాసులారా! గతంలో ఒక గొప్ప నిర్ణయాన్ని తీసుకున్నాం. ఈ పరిశోధనలో మరిన్ని సత్ఫలితాలు సాధించేందుకు లేజర్ ఇంటర్ ఫెరో మీటర్ గ్రావిటేషనల్- వేవ్ అబ్జర్వేటరీ.. సంక్షిప్తంగా చెప్పాలంటే.. ‘లిగో’ను భారతదేశంలో ఏర్పాటు చేయాలని నిర్ణయించడం జరిగింది. ప్రపంచంలో రెండు చోట్ల మాత్రమే ఇలాంటి వ్యవస్థ ఉంది. భారతదేశం మూడోది. ఈ కృషిలో భారతదేశం కూడా పాలుపంచుకోవడంతో, కొత్త శక్తి వస్తుంది; కొత్త వేగం పుంజుకొంటుంది. తనకున్న సదుపాయాలతోనే మానవ వికాసానికి దోహదం చేసే ఈ మహోన్నత వైజ్ఞానిక పరిశోధనా ప్రక్రియలో మన దేశం సక్రియాత్మక భాగస్వామి అవుతుంది. నేను మరొక్క సారి శాస్త్రవేత్తలందరికీ అభినందనలు, శుభాకాంక్షలు తెలియజేస్తున్నాను.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశ వాసులారా…!\nనేను మీకు ఒక నంబర్ ఇస్తున్నాను. రేపటి నుంచి ఆ నంబర్ కు మిస్ డ్ కాల్ ఇచ్చి ఆ నంబర్ నుంచి నా ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’ వినగలుగుతారు. మీ మాతృ భాషలో కూడా వినవచ్చు. మిస్ డ్ కాల్ ఇవ్వడానికి నంబర్ 81908 – 81908.\nమరో సారి నంబర్ చెబుతున్నాను 81908 – 81908.\nమిత్రులారా…!\nమీ పరీక్షలు ప్రారంభం అవుతున్నాయి. నేను కూడా రేపు పరీక్ష రాయాల్సి ఉంది. 125 కోట్ల మంది దేశ ప్రజలు నన్ను పరీక్షించనున్నారు. అదేమిటో తెలుసా.. రేపు బడ్జెట్ ఉంది. 29 ఫిబ్రవరి. ఇది లీప్ సంవత్సరం. అయితే మీరు చూశారు.. నా మాటలు వినగానే మీకు తెలుసుంటుంది నేను ఎంత ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉన్నానో, ఎంత ఆత్మ విశ్వాసంతో ఉన్నానో. సరే.. నా పరీక్ష పూర్తవుతుంది. ఎల్లుండి మీ పరీక్షలు మొదలవుతాయి. మనం అందరం ఉత్తీర్ణులమవుదాం. దాంతో, దేశం కూడా సఫలమవుతుంది.\nమరి మిత్రులారా..!\nమీకు కూడా ఎన్నెన్నో శుభాకాంక్షలు. బోలెడన్ని శుభాభినందనలు. సాఫల్య – వైఫల్యాల ఆందోళన నుంచి బయటపడి విముక్తమైన మనసులతో ముందుకు సాగండి; దృఢంగా సాగుతూనే ఉండండి.\nధన్యవాదములు.\n\n\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.\nWhile listening to this month’s Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your children’s exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March. That must be playing on your mind. I wish to be a part of this journey along with you. I am concerned about your children’s exams as much as you are, but I am not worried. If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.\nWhen I shared my inner thoughts with you during last month’s Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App. It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.\nThere are two things that have moved me. First, those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject; and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter. Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families. But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.\nToday, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers. I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told. I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly. I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them. That’s how I feel about it.\nMy dear students, before I begin, why not let a well-known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life? That would definitely be useful for you. He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by — Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:\n“Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking. I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now. Many of you are going to be tense about them. I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you. Wherever you go, you will be asked ‘How are the preparations going? How many marks are you likely to score?’ I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Don’t come under the pressure of someone else’s expectations. You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target. When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well. I faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too. But people always had high expectations from me. As time passed, their expectations kept growing. So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this. That’s when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets. If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country. And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself. My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own. I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking. Positive results will follow. So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that. My best wishes to you all. Please go write your exams, free from tension,and get good results. Good luck!”\nFriends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say. Don’t buckle under the pressure of expectations. It is you who have to shape your own future. So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities. I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you. Also, why should there be rivalry? Why not healthy competition? Why do we waste our time competing with others? Why don’t we compete with ourselves? Why don’t we decide to break our own previous record? If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction. There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.\nFriends, don’t look at exams as a game of numbers. “How much did I score, where did I score?” – don’t get trapped in this score-keeping. You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to. Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not. So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience. Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream; each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal. So don’t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year. Have a large perspective and a goal, and move ahead. Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed. Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.\nThousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app. Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only. Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit. On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk. But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held. And that is, your schedule matters. In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.\nI agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy — he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one’s preparation. One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time. This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little. This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.\nI do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible. I am fortunate that although I sleep very less, I sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep. But I would like to request you all to get proper sleep. There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep. And then they ponder over things they chatted about. How can they get proper sleep? When I talk of sleep, please don’t think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams. At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension. I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping. It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that it’s because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off. I hope you will not do that. I am sure you won’t do anything like that.\nDiscipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives. A strong foundation comes from discipline. Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night. They might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment. You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesn’t feel well. Not just that, our entire routine collapses. So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant. Please see to it that you don’t compromise on the time you have set for things. Don’t get into this mess. Do things the way you have planned them.\nFriends, I have seen that there are two types of students. There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points. The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult. You must have noticed this too. Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well. On the other hand, students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper. Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world. He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences. Come, why don’t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him!\n“Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand. First of all, let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams. I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that. I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life. You need to be well rested, get a good night’s sleep, you need to be on a full stomach, you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm. It is very, very similar to a game of Chess. When you play, you don’t know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you don’t know, which question will appear in an exam. So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment. So stay calm. It is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself, don’t keep your expectations too high. Just see it as a challenge – do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems. At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you don’t remember very well. You may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students, while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter. If you revise the questions you find difficult, you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam, you will be able to deal with them much better. So stay calm, get a good night’s sleep, don’t be over-confident but don’t be pessimistic either. I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before. So stay confident and all the very best to you.”\nVishwanathan Anand has really said something very important. You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure. He is so focussed. You must have seen his eyes don’t wander off the chess board. We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird. In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity. It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try. Why don’t we try to do that in a light-hearted manner? If we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days, we would find inner peace. If you don’t speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind. Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.\nJust imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom. Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface. Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before? If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen. But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.\nThere is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth. If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.\nI would like to tell you a little thing about myself. There are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which I need to know more, I have to concentrate on what is being said. There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up. Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself. I do deep-breathing. I breathe deeply three to five times. Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand. This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.\nRajat Agarwal has told us something good. He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed. We should chat with them. This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong. And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper. They ask us what we wrote, then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score, whether it will be 40, 80 or 90. In this way, your mind is totally consumed by what is already over. And what do you do? You also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone. “What did you write, what was your answer, what did you do, what do you think… Oh! I got that one wrong… I made a mistake there… Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldn’t remember it then…” We just get caught in all that. Friends, please don’t do this. What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself. Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter. If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw. Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents. What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.\nFriends, what can I tell you about peace of mind today, before you go for your exams. A message has come for you from someone, who is essentially a teacher-turned-a-value educator. From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world. Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students. He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.\n“I am Murari Bapu speaking and I would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams. Decide upon clear thinking, focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam. And whatever situation appears, accept it. My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances. If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success. And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse. Nor will you be arrogant of your success. I would like to conclude my message with a couplet – ‘It cannot be that one succeeds each time. Learn to also live with failures’. I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.”\nI am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.\nFriends I want to tell you about another thing today. I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga. And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga. This is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from India. It’s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.\nJust see how many people on my mobile App… Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, ShriAbhijeet Kulkarni… countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of Yoga. Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair. But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time. If you do Yoga, keep doing it. One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind. It is one of the simplest keys; you must pay more attention to it.\nYes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes. See if you can do it. I have a lot of faith in Yoga.\nMy dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place. But why should you do these things in a hurry. Why can’t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam. Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress. One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time. It is not like that dear friends. You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss. In fact, it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won’t have any regrets. I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it. We know – Ah! Yes, that’s the way we have to go about it! I urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time, you must go through the question paper carefully.\nYash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, “this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again”, he writes, “I was able to understand this paper quite easily… When I read the questions the first time, I felt I did not know the answers to them, but when I read them again, then I realised that the questions had been posed in a different way.” It is very important to understand the questions. When we don’t understand the questions, that’s when we sometimes find them difficult. I forcefully support the point that Yash Nagar has made. You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.\nIt gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students. Come,let me tell you the message of Shri Rao.\n“This is C.N.R. Rao from Bangalore. I fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety. That too competitive examinations. Do not worry, do your best. That’s what I tell all my young friends. At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country. Decide what you want to do in life and don’t give it up. You will succeed. Do not forget that you are a child of the universe. You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains. All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity. With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours. I wish you luck in everything you want to do. God Bless.”\nSee the style of talking that a scientist has! What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes. This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses. I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence… just keep at it my friends. If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid. And a golden future awaits you for doing well.\nRuchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience. She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well. All contributed to a positive environment. This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind. We have to radiate a positive energy.\nThere are many things that inspire us, and don’t think that they inspire only students. No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble. We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison. But friends, have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work, how many times he met with failure, how much time had to be devoted, how much money was spent, how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures. But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.\nWho doesn’t know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians? Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics? Yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. He had a life riddled with difficulties. Despite that, he gave a lot to this world before passing away. J.K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone’s life at any time. The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide. But it was not like that from the start. She had to face many difficulties, many problems. J. K. Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.\nExams are not just for the students, they also put the students’ families, schools and teachers to test. Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance. If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.\nKeshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks. They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams. They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.\nVijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations. They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible. They should help maintain their children’s faith in themselves. And this is so right.\nToday, I don’t want to say much to the parents. Please don’t create any pressure for your children. If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please don’t stop them. Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with. You will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself.\nFriends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations. Every moment there is a new innovation, a new technology. We get to see new facets of science all the time. Its impact is overwhelming; we all want to link ourselves to science and technology. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science. I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country. Every year this day is observed on 28th February. On 28th February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman had declared his discovery of the “Raman Effect”. This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize. And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day. Curiosity is the mother of science. Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation. And innovation is not possible without science and technology. Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance. Science, knowledge, technology… all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is ‘Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations’. I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.V. Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.\nFriends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely. As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well. You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science. Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success. Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists. This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve. This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics. It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it. I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists. Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward; India will be a part of future international efforts.\nMy dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision. To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India. This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third. This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others. India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind. I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue. The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.\nFriends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow. I have to take an exam tomorrow. 125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam. You know it, don’t you? Tomorrow is Budget Day. 29th February. It is a leap year. But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am. My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter. Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.\nSo friends lots of good wishes to you all. Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind. Keep going at it.\nThank You.\n"
