        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue. On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees. But the matter would remain at a standstill. This has been everybody’s experience. No one ever thought beyond this.\nToday, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this. I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses. At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves. We should have implicit faith in the people. I had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500-2000 rupees per year, then why don’t you give up your subsidy on gas? This could be of use to poor households. I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. These one crore are not wealthy families. Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy. Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it. They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone. There were many options. But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers. Here, these one crore families have given up their subsidy. And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect. A thing like that they have chosen to give up.\nI would like to salute those one crore families. I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently. Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom. At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. Externally, it appears just an incident But, its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people, it leads to most handsome achievements.\nI would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined. We should move in this direction. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.\nSometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker. Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India. We can undertake several such experiments. Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results. Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts. We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere. This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.\nA person called Ravi has written to me – “Good News Everyday — he writes — please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day. Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every ‘breaking news’. Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people? Please change this situation.”\nRavi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions. You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, used to always say, “Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper”. He used to continuously repeat that.\nSome days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news. These days I have noticed that some T.V. channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news.\nSo it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news. And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news. It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.\nIt is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things. If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled. You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india. On this you get news of positive happenings, not just of the government but also of the people around. This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing that’s happened to you. You can contribute to the site.\nRaviji you have given a good suggestion, but please don’t get angry with me. We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.\nThere is one great speciality of our country — the Kumbh Mela. The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well. Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival. The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul. These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and people’s participation, set new and high standards. I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela. I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them. What an atmosphere that would create. People will also come to know of the myriad and different activities going on in every corner of the Kumbh Mela. This can surely be done.\nIt’s true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness. It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them. I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion. We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values. It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages. We should use each Kumbh Mela to make people aware of how we can increase our value for water, our faith in water; how we can spread the message of water conservation. We should do this.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today. My heartiest thanks to you all. As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.\nMany thanks!\n"

        "article": "\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आप सबको नमस्कार। छुट्टियों में कई कार्यक्रम हर कोई बनाता है। और छुट्टियों में आम का season होता है, तो ये भी मन करता है कि आम का मज़ा लें और कभी ये भी मन करता है कि कुछ पल दोपहर को सोने का मौका मिल जाए, तो अच्छा होगा। लेकिन इस बार की भयंकर गर्मी ने चारों तरफ सारा मज़ा किरकिरा कर दिया है। देश में चिंता होना बहुत स्वाभाविक है और उसमें भी, जब लगातार सूखा पड़ता है, तो पानी-संग्रह के जो स्थान होते हैं, वो भी कम पड़ जाते हैं। कभी-कभार encroachment के कारण, silting के कारण, पानी आने के जो प्रवाह हैं, उसमें रुकावटों के कारण, जलाशय भी अपनी क्षमता से काफी कम पानी संग्रहीत करते हैं और सालों के क्रम के कारण उसकी संग्रह-क्षमता भी कम हो जाती है। सूखे से निपटने के लिए पानी के संकट से राहत के लिए सरकारें अपना प्रयास करें, वो तो है, लेकिन मैंने देखा है कि नागरिक भी बहुत ही अच्छे प्रयास करते हैं। कई गाँवों में जागरूकता देखी जाती है और पानी का मूल्य क्या है, वो तो वही जानते हैं, जिन्होनें पानी की तकलीफ़ झेली है। और इसलिए ऐसी जगह पर, पानी के संबंध में एक संवेदनशीलता भी होती है और कुछ-न-कुछ करने की सक्रियता भी होती है। मुझे कुछ दिन पहले कोई बता रहा था कि महाराष्ट्र के अहमदनगर ज़िले के हिवरे बाज़ार ग्राम पंचायत और वहाँ के गाँव वालों ने पानी को गाँव के एक बहुत बड़े संवेदनशील Issue के रूप में address किया। जल संचय करने की इच्छा करने वाले तो कई गाँव मिल जाते हैं, लेकिन इन्होंने तो किसानों के साथ बातचीत करके पूरी cropping pattern बदल दी। ऐसी फसल, जो सबसे ज्यादा पानी उपयोग करती थी, चाहे गन्ना हो, केला हो, ऐसी फसलों को छोड़ने का निर्णय कर लिया। सुनने में बात बहुत सरल लगती है, लेकिन इतनी सरल नहीं है। सबने मिल करके कितना बड़ा संकल्प किया होगा? किसी कारख़ाना वाला पानी का उपयोग करता हो, कहोगे, तुम कारख़ाना बंद करो, क्योंकि पानी ज्यादा लेते हो, तो क्या परिणाम आएगा, आप जानते हैं। लेकिन ये मेरे किसान भाई, देखिए, उनको लगा कि भाई, गन्ना बहुत पानी लेता है, तो गन्ना छोड़ो, उन्होंने छोड़ दिया। और पूरा उन्होंने fruit और vegetable, जिसमें कम-से-कम पानी की ज़रूरत पड़ती है, ऐसी फसलों पर चले गए। उन्होंने sprinkler, drip Irrigation, टपक सिंचाई, water harvesting, water recharging – इतने सारे Initiative लिये कि आज गाँव पानी के संकट के सामने जूझने के लिए अपनी ताकत पर खड़ा हो गया। ठीक है, मैं एक छोटे से गाँव हिवरे बाज़ार की चर्चा भले करता हूँ, लेकिन ऐसे कई गाँव होंगे। मैं ऐसे सभी गाँववासियों को भी बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ आपके इस उत्तम काम के लिए।\nमुझे किसी ने बताया कि मध्य प्रदेश में देवास ज़िले में गोरवा गाँव पंचायत। पंचायत ने प्रयत्न करके farm pond बनाने का अभियान चलाया। करीब 27 farm ponds बनाए और उसके कारण ground water level में बढ़ोत्तरी हुई, पानी ऊपर आया। जब भी पानी की ज़रूरत पड़ी फ़सल को, पानी मिला और वो मोटा-मोटा हिसाब बताते थे, करीब उनकी कृषि उत्पादन में 20 प्रतिशत वृद्धि हुई। तो पानी तो बचा ही बचा और जब पानी का water table ऊपर आता है, तो पानी की quality में भी बहुत सुधार होता है। और दुनिया में ऐसा कहते हैं, शुद्ध पीने का पानी GDP growth का कारण बन जाता है, स्वास्थ्य का तो बनता ही बनता है। कभी-कभार तो लगता है कि जब भारत सरकार रेलवे से पानी लातूर पहुँचाती है, तो दुनिया के लिए वो एक ख़बर बन जाती है। ये बात सही है कि जिस तेज़ी से railway ने काम किया, वो बधाई की पात्र तो है, लेकिन वो गाँव वाले भी उतने ही बधाई के पात्र हैं। मैं तो कहूँगा, उससे भी ज्यादा बधाई के पात्र हैं। लेकिन ऐसी अनेक योजनाएँ, नागरिकों के द्वारा चलती हैं, वो कभी सामने नहीं आती हैं। सरकार की अच्छी बात तो कभी-कभी सामने आ भी जाती है, लेकिन कभी हम अपने अगल-बगल में देखेंगे, तो ध्यान में आएगा कि सूखे के खिलाफ़ किस-किस प्रकार से लोग, नये-नये तौर-तरीके से, समस्या के समाधान के लिए प्रयास करते रहते हैं।\nमनुष्य का स्वभाव है, कितने ही संकट से गुजरता हो, लेकिन कहीं से कोई अच्छी ख़बर आ जाए, तो जैसे पूरा संकट दूर हो गया, ऐसा feel होता है। जब से ये जानकारी सार्वजनिक हुई कि इस बार वर्षा 106 प्रतिशत से 110 प्रतिशत तक होने की संभावना है, जैसे मानो एक बहुत बड़ा शान्ति का सन्देश आ गया हो। अभी तो वर्षा आने में समय है, लेकिन अच्छी वर्षा की ख़बर भी एक नयी चेतना ले आयी।\nलेकिन मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, अच्छी वर्षा होगी, ये समाचार जितना आनंद देता है, उतना ही हम सबके लिए एक अवसर भी देता है, चुनौती भी देता है। क्या हम गाँव-गाँव पानी बचाने के लिये, एक अभी से अभियान चला सकते हैं! किसानों को मिट्टी की जरुरत पड़ती है, खेत में वो फसल के नाते काम आती है। क्यों न हम इस बार गाँव के तालाबों से मिट्टी उठा-उठा करके खेतों में ले जाएँ, तो खेत की ज़मीन भी ठीक होगी, तो उसकी जल-संचय की ताकत भी बढ़ जायेगी। कभी सीमेंट के बोरे में, कभी fertilizer के खाली बोरे में, पत्थर और मिट्टी भरके जहाँ से पानी जाने के रास्ते हैं, उस पानी को रोका जा सकता है क्या? पाँच दिन पानी रुकेगा, सात दिन पानी रुकेगा, तो पानी ज़मीन में जाएगा। तो ज़मीन में पानी के level ऊपर आयेंगे। हमारे कुओं में पानी आएगा। जितना पानी हो सकता है, रोकना चाहिए। वर्षा का पानी, गाँव का पानी गाँव में रहेगा, ये अगर हम संकल्प करके कुछ न कुछ करें और ये सामूहिक प्रयत्नों से संभव है। तो आज भले पानी का संकट है, सूखे की स्थिति है, लेकिन आने वाला महीना – डेढ़ महीने का हमारे पास समय है और मैं तो हमेशा कहता हूँ, कभी हम पोरबंदर महात्मा गाँधी के जन्म-स्थान पर जाएँ, तो जो वहाँ अलग-अलग स्थान हम देखते हैं, तो उसमें एक जगह वो भी देखने जैसी है कि वर्षा के पानी को बचाने के लिए, घर के नीचे किस प्रकार के tank दो सौ-दो सौ साल पुराने बने हुए हैं और वो पानी कितना शुद्ध रहता था।\nकोई श्रीमान कुमार कृष्णा, उन्होंने MyGov पर लिखा है और एक प्रकार से जिज्ञासा भी व्यक्त की है। वो कहते हैं कि हमारे रहते हुए कभी गंगा सफाई का अभियान संभव होगा क्या! उनकी चिंता बहुत स्वाभाविक है, क्योंकि करीब-करीब 30 साल से ये काम चल रहा है। कई सरकारें आईं, कई योजनायें बनीं, ढेर सारा खर्चा भी हुआ और इसके कारण, भाई कुमार कृष्णा जैसे देश के करोड़ों लोगों के मन में ये सवाल होना बहुत स्वाभाविक है। जो लोग धार्मिक आस्था में रहते हैं, उनके लिए गंगा मोक्षदायिनी है। लेकिन मैं उस माहात्म्य को तो स्वीकार करूंगा ही, पर इससे ज्यादा मुझे लगता है कि गंगा ये जीवनदायिनी है। गंगा से हमें रोटी मिलती है। गंगा से हमें रोज़ी मिलती है। गंगा से हमें जीने की एक नयी ताक़त मिलती है। गंगा जैसे बहती है, देश की आर्थिक गतिविधि को भी एक नयी गति देती है। एक भगीरथ ने गंगा तो हमें ला कर दे दी, लेकिन बचाने के लिए करोड़ों-करोड़ों भगीरथों की ज़रूरत है। जन भागीदारी के बिना ये काम कभी सफल हो ही नहीं सकता है और इसलिए हम सबने सफाई के लिए, स्वच्छता के लिए, एक change agent बनना पड़ेगा। बार-बार बात को दोहराना पड़ेगा, कहना पड़ेगा। सरकार की तरफ़ से कई सारे प्रयास चल रहे हैं। गंगा तट पर जो-जो राज्य हैं, उन राज्यों का भी भरपूर सहयोग लेने का प्रयास हो रहा है। सामाजिक, स्वैच्छिक संगठनों को भी जोड़ने का प्रयास हो रहा है। surface cleaning और Industrial प्रदूषण पर रोकने के लिए काफी कदम उठाए हैं। हर दिन गंगा में बड़ी मात्रा में, नालों के रास्ते से ठोस कचरा बह करके अन्दर आता है। ऐसे कचरे को साफ़ करने के लिए वाराणसी, इलाहाबाद, कानपुर, पटना – ऐसे स्थानों पर trash skimmer पानी में तैरते-तैरते कचरा साफ़ करने का काम करते हैं। सभी local bodies को ये मुहैया कराया गया है और उनसे आग्रह किया गया है कि इसको लगातार चलाएँ और वहीं से कचरा साफ़ करते चलें। और पिछले दिनों मुझे जो बताया गया कि जहाँ बड़े अच्छे ढंग से प्रयास होता है, वहाँ तो तीन टन से ग्यारह टन तक प्रतिदिन कचरा निकाला जाता है। तो ये तो बात सही है कि इतनी मात्रा में गंदगी बढ़ने से रुक ही रही है। आने वाले दिनों में और भी स्थानों पर trash skimmer लगाने की योजना है और उसका लाभ गंगा और यमुना तट के लोगों को तुरंत अनुभव भी होगा। Industrial प्रदूषण पर नियन्त्रण के लिए pulp and paper, distillery एवं sugar Industry के साथ एक action plan प्लान बन गया है। कुछ मात्रा में लागू होना शुरू भी हुआ है। उसके भी अच्छे परिणाम निकलेंगे, ऐसा अभी तो मुझे लग रहा है।\nमुझे इस बात की ख़ुशी है कि मुझे बताया गया कि उत्तराखंड एवं उत्तर प्रदेश, वहाँ जो distillery का जो discharge होता था, तो पिछले दिनों कुछ अफसर मुझे बता रहे थे कि zero liquid discharge की ओर उन्होंने सफलता पा ली है। Pulp and Paper Industry या Black liquor की निकासी लगभग पूरी तरह ख़त्म हो रही है। ये सारे इस बात के संकेत हैं कि हम सही दिशा में बढ़ रहे हैं और एक जागरूकता भी बढ़ी है। और मैंने देखा है कि सिर्फ़ गंगा के तट के नहीं, दूर-सुदूर दक्षिण का भी कोई व्यक्ति मिलता है, तो ज़रूर कहता है कि साहब, गंगा सफ़ाई तो होगी न! तो यही एक जो जन-सामान्य की आस्था है, वो गंगा सफ़ाई में ज़रूर सफलता दिलाएगी। गंगा स्वच्छता के लिये लोग donation भी दे रहे हैं। एक काफ़ी अच्छे ढंग से इस व्यवस्था को चलाया जा रहा है।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आज 24 अप्रैल है। भारत में इसे ‘पंचायती राज दिवस’ के रूप में मनाया जाता है। आज ही के दिन पंचायती राज व्यवस्था का हमारे देश में आरम्भ हुआ था और आज धीरे-धीरे पूरे देश में पंचायती राज व्यवस्था हमारी लोकतांत्रिक राजव्यवस्था की एक महत्वपूर्ण इकाई के रूप में सफलतापूर्वक कार्य कर रहा है।\n14 अप्रैल बाबा साहब आंबेडकर की 125वीं जयंती हम मना रहे थे और आज 24 अप्रैल, ‘पंचायती राज दिवस’ मना रहे हैं। ये ऐसा सुभग संयोग था, जिस महापुरुष ने हमें भारत का संविधान दिया, उस दिन से लेकर के 24 तारीख़, जो कि संविधान की सबसे बड़ी मजबूत कड़ी है, वो हमारा गाँव – दोनों को जोड़ने की प्रेरणा और इसलिए भारत सरकार ने राज्य सरकारों के सहयोग के साथ 14 अप्रैल से 24 अप्रैल, 10 दिन ग्रामोदय से भारतोदय अभियान चलाया। ये मेरा सौभाग्य था कि 14 अप्रैल को बाबा साहब आंबेडकर जी के जन्मदिन मुझे बाबा साहब आंबेडकर का जन्म स्थान महू, वहाँ जाने का अवसर मिला। उस पवित्र धरती को नमन करने का अवसर मिला। और आज 24 तारीख़ को मैं झारखण्ड में, जहाँ हमारे अधिकतम आदिवासी भाई-बहन रहते हैं, उस प्रदेश में आज जा करके ‘पंचायती राज दिवस’ मनाने वाला हूँ और दोपहर को 3 बजे फिर एक बार ‘पंचायती राज दिवस’ पर मैं देश की सभी पंचायतों से बातचीत करने वाला हूँ। इस अभियान ने एक बहुत बड़ा जागरूकता का काम किया है। हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने में गाँव के स्तर पर लोकतांत्रिक संस्थाएँ कैसे मजबूत बनें? गाँव स्वयं आत्मनिर्भर कैसे बनें? ग्राम स्वयं अपने विकास की योजना कैसे बनाएँ? Infrastructure का भी महत्व हो, social Infrastructure का भी महत्व हो। गाँव में dropout न हों, बच्चे स्कूल न छोड़ दें, ‘बेटी बचाओ – बेटी पढ़ाओ’ अभियान सफलता पूर्वक चले। बेटी का जन्मदिन गाँव का महोत्सव बनना चाहिये, कई ऐसी योजनायें, कुछ गाँव में तो food donation का कार्यक्रम हुआ। शायद ही एक साथ हिन्दुस्तान के इतने गाँवों में इतने विविध कार्यक्रम 10 दिन चले हों, ये बहुत कम होता है। मैं, सभी राज्य सरकारों को, ग्राम प्रधानों को इस बात के लिए बधाई देता हूँ कि आपने बहुत ही मौलिक तरीक़े से नवीनता के साथ, इस पूरे अवसर को गाँव की भलाई के लिये, गाँव के विकास के लिये, लोकतंत्र की मज़बूती के लिये, एक अवसर में परिवर्तित किया। गाँवों में जो जागरूकता आयी है, वही तो भारत-उदय की गारंटी है। भारत-उदय का आधार ग्राम-उदय ही है और इसलिए ग्राम-उदय पर हम सब बल देते रहेंगे, तो इच्छित परिणाम प्राप्त करके ही रहेंगे।\nमुम्बई से शर्मिला धारपुरे, आपने मुझे फ़ोन कॉल पर अपनी चिंता जतायी है: –\n“प्रधानमंत्री जी नमस्कार, मैं, शर्मिला धारपुरे बोल रही हूँ, मुम्बई से। मेरा आपसे, स्कूल और college education के बारे में सवाल है। जैसे education sector में पिछले बहुत वर्षों से सुधार की जरुरत पाई गयी है। पर्याप्त स्कूलों का या colleges का न होना या फिर शिक्षा में education की quality न होना। ऐसा पाया गया है कि बच्चे अपना education पूरा भी कर लेते हैं, उन्हें फिर भी अक्सर basic चीज़ों के बारे में पता नहीं होता है। उससे हमारे बच्चे दुनिया की दौड़ में पीछे पड़ जाते हैं। इस बारे में आपके क्या विचार हैं और आप इस sector को किस तरह से इसमें सुधार लाना चाहते हैं? इसके बारे में कृपया हमें बताइए। धन्यवाद!”\nये चिंता बहुत स्वाभाविक है। आज हर परिवार में माँ-बाप का अगर पहला कोई सपना रहता है, तो वो रहता है बच्चों की अच्छी शिक्षा। घर-गाड़ी, सब बाद में विचार आता है और भारत जैसे देश के लिए जन-मन की ये भावना है, वो बहुत बड़ी ताक़त है। बच्चों को पढ़ाना और अच्छा पढ़ाना। अच्छी शिक्षा मिले, उसकी चिंता होना – ये और अधिक बढ़ना चाहिये, और अधिक जागरूकता आनी चाहिए। और मैं मानता हूँ, जिन परिवारों में ये जागरूकता होती है, उसका असर स्कूलों पर भी आता है, शिक्षकों पर भी आता है और बच्चा भी जागरूक होता जाता है कि मैं स्कूल में इस काम के लिए जा रहा हूँ। और इसलिये, मैं, सभी अभिभावकों से, माँ-बाप से सबसे पहले यह आग्रह करूँगा कि बच्चे के साथ, स्कूल की हो रही गतिविधियों से विस्तार से समय देकर के बातें करें। और कुछ बात ध्यान में आए, तो खुद स्कूल में जा करके शिक्षकों से बात करें। ये जो vigilance है, ये भी हमारी शिक्षा व्यवस्था में कई बुराइयों को कम कर सकता है और जन भागीदारी से तो ये होना ही होना है। हमारे देश में सभी सरकारों ने शिक्षा पर बल दिया है और हर कोई सरकार ने अपने-अपने तरीक़े से प्रयास भी किया है। और ये भी सच्चाई है कि काफ़ी अरसे तक हम लोगों का ध्यान इसी बात पर रहा कि शिक्षा संस्थान खड़े हों, शिक्षा व्यवस्था का विस्तार हो, स्कूल बनें, colleges बनें, teachers की भर्ती हो, अधिकतम बच्चे स्कूल आएँ। तो, एक प्रकार से, शिक्षा को चारों तरफ़ फ़ैलाने का प्रयास, ये प्राथमिकता रही और ज़रूरी भी था, लेकिन अब जितना महत्व विस्तार का है, उससे भी ज़्यादा महत्व हमारी शिक्षा में सुधार का है। विस्तार का एक बहुत बड़ा काम हम कर चुके हैं। अब हमें, quality education पर focus करना ही होगा। साक्षरता अभियान से अब अच्छी शिक्षा, ये हमारी प्राथमिकता बनानी पड़ेगी। अब तक हिसाब-किताब outlay का होता था, अब हमें outcome पर ही focus करना पड़ेगा। अब तक स्कूल में कितने आये, उस पर बल था, अब schooling से ज़्यादा learning की ओर हमें बल देना होगा। Enrollment, enrollment, enrollment – ये मंत्र लगातार गूँजता रहा, लेकिन अब, जो बच्चे स्कूल में पहुंचे हैं, उनको अच्छी शिक्षा, योग्य शिक्षा, इसी पर हमने ध्यान केन्द्रित करना होगा। वर्तमान सरकार का बजट भी आपने देखा होगा। अच्छी शिक्षा पर बल देने का प्रयास हो रहा है। ये बात सही है कि बहुत बड़ी लम्बी सफ़र काटनी है। लेकिन अगर हम सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासी तय करें, तो, लम्बी सफ़र भी कट सकती है। लेकिन शर्मिला जी की बात सही है कि हम में आमूलचूल सुधार लाने की ज़रूरत है।\nइस बार बजट में आपने देखा होगा कि लीक से हटकर के काम किया गया है। बजट के अन्दर, दस सरकारी University और दस Private University – उनको सरकारी बंधनों से मुक्ति देने का और challenge route पर उनको आने के लिए कहा है कि आइये, आप top most University बनने के लिए क्या करना चाहते हैं, बताइये। उनको खुली छूट देने के इरादे से ये योजना रखी गयी है। भारत की Universities भी वैश्विक स्पर्धा करने वाली University बन सकती है, बनानी भी चाहिए। इसके साथ-साथ जितना महत्व शिक्षा का है, उतना ही महत्व skill का है, उसी प्रकार से शिक्षा में technology बहुत बड़ा role play करेगी। Long Distance Education, technology – ये हमारी शिक्षा को सरल भी बनाएगी और ये बहुत ही निकट भविष्य में इसके परिणाम नज़र आएँगे, ऐसा मुझे विश्वास है।\nबड़े लम्बे समय से एक विषय पर लोग मुझे पूछते रहते हैं, कुछ लोग web portal MyGov पर लिखते हैं, कुछ लोग मुझे NarendraModiApp पर लिखते हैं, और ज़्यादातर ये नौजवान लिखते हैं।\n“प्रधानमंत्री जी नमस्कार! मैं मोना कर्णवाल बोल रही हूँ, बिजनौर से। आज के जमाने में युवाओं के लिए पढ़ाई के साथ-साथ sports का भी बहुत महत्व है। उनमें team spirit की भावना भी होनी चाहिए और अच्छे leader होने के गुण भी होने चाहिए, जिससे कि उनका overall holistic development हो। ये मैं अपने experience से कह रही हूँ, क्योंकि, मैं, खुद भी Bharat Scouts and Guides में रह चुकी हूँ और इसका मेरे जीवन में बहुत ही अच्छा प्रभाव पड़ा। मैं चाहती हूँ कि आप ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा युवाओं को motivate करें। मैं चाहती हूँ कि सरकार भी ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा NCC, NSS और Bharat Scouts and Guides को promote करे।”\nआप लोग मुझे इतने सुझाव भेजते रहते थे, तो एक दिन मुझे भी लगा कि मैं आप लोगों से बात करूँ कि इससे पहले मैं इन सबसे से बातचीत करूँ। तो आप ही लोगों का दबाव था, आप ही लोगों के सुझाव थे, उसका परिणाम ये हुआ कि मैंने ऐसी एक अभी meeting बुलायी, जिसमें NCC के मुखिया थे, NSS के थे, Scout and Guide के थे, Red Cross के थे, नेहरु युवा केंद्र के थे। और जब मैंने उनको पूछा कि पहले कब मिले थे, तो उन्होंने कहा, नहीं-नहीं भाई, हम तो देश आज़ाद होने के बाद इस प्रकार की meeting ये पहली हुई है। तो मैं सबसे पहले तो उन युवा-मित्रों का अभिनन्दन करता हूँ कि जिन्होंने मुझ पर दबाव डाला इन सारे कामों के संबंध में। और उसी का परिणाम है कि मैंने meeting की और मुझे लगा कि अच्छा हुआ कि मैं मिला। बहुत co-ordination की आवश्यकता लगी मुझे। अपने–अपने तरीक़े से बहुत-कुछ हो रहा है, लेकिन अगर सामूहिक रूप से, संगठित रूप से हमारे भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकार के संगठन काम करें, तो कितना बड़ा परिणाम दे सकते हैं। और कितना बड़ा फैलाव है उनका, कितने परिवारों तक ये पहुँचे हुए हैं। तो मुझे इनका व्याप देखकर के तो बड़ा ही समाधान हुआ। और उनका उमंग भी बहुत था, कुछ-न-कुछ करना था। और ये तो बात सही है कि मैं तो स्वयं ही NCC का Cadet रहा हूँ, तो मुझे मालूम है कि ऐसे संगठनों से एक नई दृष्टि मिलती है, प्रेरणा मिलती है, एक राष्ट्रीय दृष्टिकोण पनपता है। तो मुझे तो बचपन में वो लाभ मिला ही मिला है और मैं भी मानता हूँ कि इन संगठनों में एक नया प्राण भरना चाहिये, नई ताक़त भरनी चाहिये। इस बार अब मैंने उनके सामने कुछ रखे हैं विषय। मैंने उनको कहा है कि भाई, इस season में जल-संचय का बड़ा काम हमारे युवा, सारे संगठन क्यों न करें। हम लोग प्रयास करके कितने block, कितने जिले, खुले में शौच जाना बंद करवा सकते हैं। Open defecation free कैसे कर सकते हैं? देश को जोड़ने के लिए ऐसे कौन से कार्यकर्मों की रचना कर सकते हैं, हम सभी संगठनों के common युवा-गीत क्या हो सकता है? कई बातें उनके साथ हुई हैं।\nमैं आज आपसे भी आग्रह करता हूँ, आप भी मुझे बताइए, बहुत perfect सुझाव बताइए कि हमारे अनेक-अनेक युवा संगठन चलते हैं। उनकी कार्यशैली, कार्यक्रम में क्या नई चीज़ें जोड़ सकते हैं? मेरे NarendraModiApp पर आप लिखोगे, तो मैं उचित जगह पर पहुँचा दूँगा और मैं मानता हूँ कि इस meeting के बाद काफ़ी कुछ उन में गति आएगी, ऐसा तो मुझे लग रहा है और आपको भी उसके साथ जुड़ने का मन करेगा, ऐसी स्थिति तो बन ही जाएगी।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आज हम सब को सोचने के लिए मज़बूर करने वाली बात मुझे करनी है। मैं इसे हम लोगों को झकझोरने वाली बात के रूप में भी देखता हूँ। आपने देखा होगा कि हमारे देश की राजनैतिक अवस्था ऐसी है कि पिछले कई चुनावों में इस बात की चर्चा हुआ करती थी कि कौन पार्टी कितने गैस के cylinder देगी? 12 cylinder कि 9 cylinder? ये चुनाव का बड़ा मुद्दा हुआ करता था। और हर राजनैतिक दल को लगता था कि मध्यमवर्गीय समाज को चुनाव की दृष्टि से पहुँचना है, तो Gas Cylinder एक बहुत बड़ाIssue है। दूसरी तरफ़, अर्थशास्त्रियों का दबाव रहता था कि subsidy कम करो और उसके कारण कई कमेटियाँ बैठती थीं, जिसमें गैस की subsidy कम करने पर बहुत बड़े प्रस्ताव आते थे, सुझाव आते थे। इन कमेटियों के पीछे करोड़ों रुपए के खर्च होते थे। लेकिन बात वहीं की वहीं रह जाती थी। यह अनुभव सबका है। लेकिन इसके बाहर कभी सोचा नहीं गया। आज मेरे देशवासियो, आप सब को मेरा हिसाब देते हुए मुझे आनंद होता है कि मैंने तीसरा रास्ता चुना और वो रास्ता था जनता-जनार्दन पर भरोसा करने का। कभी-कभी हम राजनेताओं को भी अपने से ज़्यादा अपनों पर भरोसा करना चाहिये। मैंने जनता-जनार्दन पर भरोसा करके ऐसे ही बातों-बातों में कहा था कि अगर आप साल भर के पंद्रह सौ, दो हज़ार रुपया खर्च का बोझ सहन कर सकते हैं, तो आप gas subsidy क्यों नहीं छोड़ देते, किसी ग़रीब के काम आएगी। ऐसे ही मैंने बात कही थी, लेकिन आज मैं बड़े गर्व के साथ कह सकता हूँ, मुझे नाज़ हो रहा है मेरे देशवासियों पर।\nएक-करोड़ परिवारों ने स्वेच्छा से अपनी gas subsidy surrender कर दीI और ये एक करोड़ परिवार अमीर नहीं हैंI मैं देख रहा हूँ, कोई retired Teacher, retired Clerk, कोई किसान, कोई छोटा-सा दुकान चलाने वाला – ऐसे मध्यम-वर्ग, निम्न मध्यम-वर्ग के परिवार हैं, जिन्होंने छोड़ाI दूसरी विशेषता देखिए कि subsidy छोड़ने के लिए mobile phone की app से कर सकते थे, online कर सकते थे, telephone पर missed call करके कर सकते थे, बहुत तरीके थेI लेकिन, हिसाब लगाया गया तो पता चला कि इन एक-करोड़ परिवारों में 80 percent से ज्यादा लोग वो थे, जो स्वयं distributor के यहाँ ख़ुद गए, कतार में खड़े रहे और लिखित में देकर के उन्होंने अपनी subsidy surrender कर दीI\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, ये छोटी बात नहीं है। सरकार अगर कोई एक tax में थोड़ी-सी भी रियायत दे दे, छूट दे दे, तो हफ़्ते भर टी.वी. और अखबारों में उस सरकार की वाहवाही सुनाई देती हैI एक-करोड़ परिवारों ने subsidy छोड़ दी और हमारे देश में subsidy एक प्रकार से हक़ बन गया है, उसे छोड़ दियाI मैं सबसे पहले उन एक-करोड़ परिवारों को शत-शत नमन करता हूँ, अभिनन्दन करता हूँI क्योंकि उन्होंने राजनेताओं को नये तरीके से सोचने के लिए मजबूर कर दिया हैI इस एक घटना ने देश के अर्थशास्त्रियों को भी नये तरीके से सोचने के लिए मजबूर कर दिया हैI और दुनिया के अर्थवेत्ता भी ऐसा होगा तो ऐसा होगा, ऐसा करेंगे तो वैसा निकलेगा, इस प्रकार जो आर्थिक समीकरण बनाते हैं, उनके लिये भी उनकी सोच की मर्यादाओं से बाहर की ये घटना है। इस पर कभी-न-कभी सोचना पड़ेगाI एक-करोड़ परिवारों का सब्सिडी छोड़ना, बदले में करोड़ों ग़रीब परिवारों को गैस सिलिंडर मिलनाI एक करोड़ परिवारों का सब्सिडी छोड़ने से रुपयों का बचत होना, ये बाहरी दृष्टि से बहुत सामान्य बातें हैं। असामान्य बात ये है कि जनता पर भरोसा रखकर के काम करें, तो कितनी बड़ी सिद्धि मिलती हैI मैं ख़ासकर के पूरे political class को आज आग्रह से कहना चाहूँगा कि हम हर जगह पर जनता पर भरोसा रखने वाली एक बात ज़रूर करें। आपने कभी सोचा नहीं होगा, वैसा परिणाम हमें मिलेगाI और हमें इस दिशा में जाना चाहिएI और मुझे तो लगातार लगता है कि जैसे मेरे मन में आया कि ये वर्ग 3 और 4 के Interview क्यों करें भईI जो अपना exam देकर के marks भेज रहा है, उस पर भरोसा करेंI कभी तो मुझे ऐसा भी लगता है कि हम कभी घोषित करें कि आज रेलवे की वो जो route है, उसमें कोई ticket checker नहीं रहेगाI देखिये तो, देश की जनता पर हम भरोसा करेंI बहुत सारे प्रयोग कर सकते हैंI एक बार देश की जनता पर हम भरोसा करें, तो अप्रतिम परिणाम मिल सकते हैंI खैर, ये तो मेरे मन के विचार हैं, इसको कोई सरकार का नियम तो नहीं बना सकते, लेकिन माहौल तो बना सकते हैंI और ये माहौल कोई राजनेता नहीं बना रहा हैI देश के एक करोड़ परिवारों ने बना दिया हैI\nरवि करके किसी सज्जन ने मुझे पत्र लिखा है – “Good news every day”. वो लिख रहे हैं कि कृपया अपने अधिकारियों से कहिए कि हर दिन कोई एक अच्छी घटना के बारे में post करेंI प्रत्येक newspaper और news channel में हर breaking news, बुरी news ही होती हैI क्या सवा-सौ करोड़ आबादी वाले देश में हमारे आस-पास कुछ भी अच्छा नहीं हो रहा है? कृपया इस हालत को बदलिएI रवि जी ने बड़ा गुस्सा व्यक्त किया हैI लेकिन मैं मानता हूँ कि शायद वो मुझ पर गुस्सा नहीं कर रहे हैं, हालात पर गुस्सा कर रहे हैंI आप को याद होगा, भारत के भूतपूर्व राष्ट्रपति डॉ. ए.पी.जे. अब्दुल कलाम हमेशा ये बात कहते थे कि अख़बार के पहले पन्ने पर सिर्फ़ positive ख़बरें छापिएI वे लगातार इस बात को कहते रहते थेI कुछ दिन पहले मुझे एक अख़बार ने चिट्ठी भी लिखी थीI उन्होंने कहा था कि हमने तय किया है कि सोमवार को हम एक भी negative ख़बर नहीं देंगे, positive ख़बर ही देंगेI इन दिनों मैंने देखा है, कुछ T.V.

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue. On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees. But the matter would remain at a standstill. This has been everybody’s experience. No one ever thought beyond this.\nToday, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this. I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses. At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves. We should have implicit faith in the people. I had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500-2000 rupees per year, then why don’t you give up your subsidy on gas? This could be of use to poor households. I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. These one crore are not wealthy families. Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy. Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it. They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone. There were many options. But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers. Here, these one crore families have given up their subsidy. And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect. A thing like that they have chosen to give up.\nI would like to salute those one crore families. I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently. Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom. At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. Externally, it appears just an incident But, its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people, it leads to most handsome achievements.\nI would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined. We should move in this direction. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.\nSometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker. Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India. We can undertake several such experiments. Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results. Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts. We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere. This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.\nA person called Ravi has written to me – “Good News Everyday — he writes — please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day. Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every ‘breaking news’. Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people? Please change this situation.”\nRavi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions. You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, used to always say, “Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper”. He used to continuously repeat that.\nSome days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news. These days I have noticed that some T.V. channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news.\nSo it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news. And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news. It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.\nIt is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things. If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled. You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india. On this you get news of positive happenings, not just of the government but also of the people around. This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing that’s happened to you. You can contribute to the site.\nRaviji you have given a good suggestion, but please don’t get angry with me. We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.\nThere is one great speciality of our country — the Kumbh Mela. The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well. Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival. The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul. These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and people’s participation, set new and high standards. I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela. I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them. What an atmosphere that would create. People will also come to know of the myriad and different activities going on in every corner of the Kumbh Mela. This can surely be done.\nIt’s true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness. It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them. I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion. We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values. It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages. We should use each Kumbh Mela to make people aware of how we can increase our value for water, our faith in water; how we can spread the message of water conservation. We should do this.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today. My heartiest thanks to you all. As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.\nMany thanks!\n"

কৃষকদের মাটির প্রয়োজন, ক্ষেতে ফসলের জন্য কাজে লাগে। এবার আমরা গ্রামের পুকুর থেকে মাটি তুলে নিয়ে ক্ষেতে ঢালতে পারি না? তাতে ক্ষেতও ভাল থাকবে আর তার জল সঞ্চয়ের ক্ষমতাও বেড়ে যাবে। কখনও সিমেন্টের বস্তায়, কখনও সারের খালি বস্তায় পাথর আর মাটি ভরে জল যাওয়ার রাস্তায় সেগুলো রেখে জল সঞ্চয় করা যেতে পারে কি? পাঁচদিন বা সাতদিন জল তাহলে আটকে থাকবে, এবং ভূগর্ভে জল সঞ্চিত হবে। জলস্তর বাড়বে, আমাদের কুয়োতে জল আসবে। তাই যতটা সম্ভব জল সঞ্চয় করা প্রয়োজন। বর্ষার জল, গ্রামের জল গ্রামেই থাকবে। এই উদ্দেশ্যে যদি আমরা কিছু কাজ করি, সেটা সম্মিলিত প্রয়াসেই সম্ভব। তো আজ জলের সংকট ভালোই রয়েছে, খরা চলছে। কিন্তু আগামী মাস দেড়েক আমাদের হাতে সময় রয়েছে। আমি তো সবসময়ই বলি যে, যদি আমরা মহাত্মা গান্ধীর জন্মস্থান পোরবন্দরে যাই, তো ওখানে যে আলাদা আলাদা জায়গা আমরা দেখি, সেখানে একটি জায়গা আছে, যেখানে বৃষ্টির জল সংরক্ষণের জন্য ঘরের নীচে ২০০ বছরের পুরনো জলাশয় তৈরি করা আছে। আর সেখানে জল কতটা বিশুদ্ধ থাকে।\nশ্রীমান কুমার কৃষ্ণা ‘মাই গভ’-এ প্রশ্ন করেছেন – আমাদের জীবৎকালে গঙ্গা সাফাই অভিযান সম্ভব হবে কি? ওঁর চিন্তা খুবই স্বাভাবিক। কারণ প্রায় ৩০ বছর ধরে এই কাজ চলছে। কত সরকার এসেছে, কত প্রকল্প তৈরি হয়েছে, অনেক খরচও হয়েছে। আর তাই ভাই কুমার কৃষ্ণা-র মত দেশের কোটি কোটি মানুষের মনে এই প্রশ্ন ওঠা খুবই স্বাভাবিক। যাঁরা ধর্ম মানেন, তাঁদের কাছে গঙ্গা মোক্ষদায়িনী। আমার মনে হয় গঙ্গা শুধু মোক্ষদায়িনীই নয়, জীবন-দায়িনীও বটে। গঙ্গা আমাদের রুজি-রুটির সংস্থান করে। গঙ্গা আমাদের নতুন করে বাঁচার শক্তি যোগায়। গঙ্গা যেমন বয়ে চলে, তেমনভাবে দেশের অর্থনীতিকেও এক নতুন প্রবহমানতা দেয়। এক ভগীরথ আমাদের গঙ্গা এনে দিয়েছিলেন, কিন্তু একে বাঁচানোর জন্য কোটি কোটি ভগীরথ দরকার। জনগণের সামগ্রিক সাহায্য ছাড়া এ কাজ কখনই সম্ভব হবে না। এর পরিষ্কার-পরিচ্ছন্নতা ও স্বচ্ছতার জন্য আমাদের change agent হতে হবে। বার বার একই কথা আলোচনা করতে হবে। বলতে হবে। সরকারের তরফে অনেকগুলো প্রকল্প চলছে। গঙ্গার তীরে যেসমস্ত রাজ্য আছে, সেইসব রাজ্যের সম্পূর্ণ সহযোগিতা নেওয়ার প্রচেষ্টা চলছে। সামাজিক ও স্বেচ্ছাসেবী সংগঠনগুলোকে একাজের সঙ্গে যুক্ত করার প্রয়াস চলছে। পরিবেশ দূষণ ও কারখানার মাধ্যমে দূষণ রোধ করার জন্য নানান পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে। প্রতিদিন গঙ্গায় খুব বেশি মাত্রায় নালা-নর্দমার মাধ্যমে জঞ্জাল এসে পড়ে। এই জঞ্জাল পরিষ্কার করার জন্য বারাণসী, এলাহাবাদ, কানপুর, পাটনা ইত্যাদি নানা জায়গায় Trash skimmer জলে ভাসতে ভাসতে জঞ্জাল পরিষ্কার করতে থাকে। সমস্ত স্থানীয় সংগঠনগুলিকে জানানো হয়েছে এবং অনুরোধ করা হয়েছে যে তারা যেন এই কাজ চালু রাখেন এবং জঞ্জাল পরিষ্কারের কাজটি নিয়মিত করেন। আগে আমাকে বলা হয়েছিল, যে যেখানে প্রচেষ্টা হয় ভালোভাবে, সেখানে প্রতিদিন ৩ থেকে ১১ টন পর্যন্ত জঞ্জাল সাফ করা সম্ভব হয়। তাহলে এটা ঠিক যে আমরা এক বড়ো মাত্রায় জঞ্জাল পরিষ্কার করতে সমর্থ হচ্ছি। আগামী দিনে আরও কয়েকটি জায়গায় Trash skimmer লাগানোর পরিকল্পনা রয়েছে। আর এর উপযোগিতা গঙ্গা ও যমুনার তীরবর্তী মানুষরা খুব শীঘ্রই বুঝতে পারবেন, pulp and paper, distillery এবং sugar industry–র দূষণ নিয়ন্ত্রণের জন্য এক কার্যকরী পরিকল্পনা তৈরি করা হয়েছে। কিছু কিছু ক্ষেত্রে এই পরিকল্পনা কার্যকর করাও শুরু হয়ে গেছে। আমার মনে হয়, এই কাজের সুফল আসবে।\nগত কয়েকদিনে কিছু সরকারি কর্তাব্যক্তি আমাকে জানিয়েছে যে উত্তরাখণ্ড এবং উত্তরপ্রদেশে distillery থেকে যে বর্জ্য পদার্থ নিষ্ক্রমণ হতো, তা সম্পূর্ণ বন্ধ করতে তাঁরা সফল হয়েছেন। এটা আমার কাছে একটা আনন্দের খবর। Pulp and Paper industry বাblack liquor–এর কারখানা থেকে বর্জ্য পদার্থ নিষ্ক্রমণ প্রায় পুরোপুরি বন্ধ হয়ে যাচ্ছে। এই সব ঘটনা প্রমাণ করছে যে আমরা সঠিক লক্ষ্যের দিকে এগোচ্ছি আর সচেতনতাও বেড়েছে।\nআমি দেখেছি যে শুধু গঙ্গার তীরই নয়, সুদূর দাক্ষিণাত্যে যাঁরা বসবাস করেন, তাঁরাও অবশ্যই বলেন যে গঙ্গা সাফাই সম্পূর্ণ হবে তো? তো জনগণের এই আস্থা গঙ্গা সাফাইয়ের ক্ষেত্রে অবশ্যই সফলতা দেবে। গঙ্গার পরিচ্ছন্নতার জন্য লোকে আর্থিক সাহায্যও করছেন যার ফলে খুব ভালোভাবে এই কাজ চলছে।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, আজ ২৪-শে এপ্রিল। ভারতে এই দিনটি ‘পঞ্চায়েতি রাজ দিবস’ হিসেবে পালন করা হয়। আজকের দিনেই আমাদের দেশে পঞ্চায়েতি রাজ ব্যবস্থা চালু হয়েছিল। আর আজ সারা দেশে পঞ্চায়েতি রাজ ব্যবস্থা আমাদের গণতন্ত্রের এক গুরুত্বপূর্ণ একক হিসাবে সফলতার সঙ্গে কাজ করে চলেছে। চোদ্দই এপ্রিল আমরা বাবা সাহেব আম্বেদকরের ১২৫-তম জন্মজয়ন্তী পালন করেছি, আর আজ ২৪-শে এপ্রিল ‘পঞ্চায়েতি রাজ দিবস’ পালন করছি। এ এক সুন্দর সমাপতন। আমাদের সংবিধানের সব থেকে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ অংশ আমাদের গ্রাম। সংবিধানের সঙ্গে গ্রামকে যুক্ত করার এই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ কাজটি করার প্রেরণা তিনি। এই লক্ষ্যে তাঁর জন্মদিন\n১৪-ই এপ্রিল থেকে ২৪-শে এপ্রিল এই দশ দিন ব্যপী গ্রামোদয় থেকে ভারতোদয় অভিযান চালানো হয়েছে। এ আমার সৌভাগ্য যে ১৪-ই এপ্রিল, বাবা সাহেব আম্বেদকরের জন্মদিনে তাঁর জন্মস্থান মহু যাওয়ার সুযোগ হয়েছিল। সেই পবিত্র স্থানে প্রণাম জানানোর সুযোগ আমার হয়েছিল। আজ ২৪ তারিখ, ঝাড়খণ্ডে, যেখানে সবথেকে বেশি আদিবাসী ভাই-বোন রয়েছেন, সেখানে গিয়ে আজ আমি ‘পঞ্চায়েতি রাজ দিবস’ পালন করব। বেলা তিনটের সময় আরও একবার দেশের সব পঞ্চায়েত-এর সঙ্গে কথা বলব। এই অভিযান এক মস্ত বড়ো সচেতনতার কাজ করেছে। ভারতবর্ষের প্রতিটি গ্রামে গণতান্ত্রিক কাঠামো কীভাবে দৃঢ় করা যায়, গ্রামগুলিকে কীভাবে স্বনির্ভর করা যায়, গ্রাম নিজেই নিজের উন্নতির লক্ষ্যে নানান পরিকল্পনা কীভাবে তৈরি করবে, পরিকাঠামো, সামাজিক পরিকাঠামোর গুরুত্ব, গ্রামে ড্রপ-আউট হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা নির্মূলকরণ, বাচ্চাদের স্কুলছুট হওয়া বন্ধ করা, ‘বেটি বাঁচাও বেটি পড়াও’ অভিযান সাফল্যের সঙ্গে চালানো, কন্যার জন্মদিনকে গ্রামের উৎসবের দিন হিসাবে পালন করা ইত্যাদি নানা লক্ষ্যের সঙ্গে কিছু গ্রামে খাদ্য দানের কাজও হয়েছে। একই সঙ্গে ভারতের এতগুলো গ্রামে এতগুলো অনুষ্ঠান দশ দিন ধরে চলেছে, এরকম খুব কমই দেখা যায়। আমি সমস্ত রাজ্য সরকারকে, গ্রাম প্রধানদের এজন্য অভিনন্দন জানাচ্ছি। আপনারা অত্যন্ত মৌলিক ও নতুন পদ্ধতিতে গ্রামের উন্নতি ও সমৃদ্ধির জন্য, গণতন্ত্রকে আরও দৃঢ় করার জন্য এই সুযোগের সদ্ব্যবহার করেছেন। গ্রামে যে সচেতনতা এসেছে সেটাই তো ভারত উদয়ের মূল চাবিকাঠি। ভারত উদয়ের সাফল্য নির্ভর করে গ্রাম উদয়ের ওপর। আর তাই গ্রাম উদয়ের ওপর আমরা সবাই যত জোর দেব, ততই ঈপ্সিত ফল পাব।\nমুম্বই থেকে শর্মিলা ধারকুড়ে ফোন করে নিজের ভাবনার কথা জানিয়েছেন। –\nপ্রধানমন্ত্রীজী নমস্কার! আমি মুম্বই থেকে শর্মিলা ধারকুড়ে বলছি। আমার বিদ্যালয় ও মহাবিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষা সম্পর্কে আপনার কাছে প্রশ্ন আছে। যেমন শিক্ষাক্ষেত্রে বিগত বহু বছর ধরে সংশোধনের প্রয়োজনীয়তা আছে। যথেষ্ট পরিমানে স্কুল-কলেজ না থাকার জন্য, শিক্ষার মান যথেষ্ট না হওয়ার জন্য দেখা যায়, শিশুরা তাদের শিক্ষা সম্পূর্ণ করেছে কিন্তু তাদের অক্ষরশিক্ষা, প্রাথমিক জ্ঞান হয়নি। এজন্য আমাদের শিশুরা প্রতিযোগিতায় পিছিয়ে পড়ছে। এই ব্যাপারে আপনার ভাবনা-চিন্তা কী? আপনি এই ক্ষেত্রের উন্নতি কীভাবে করতে চাইছেন তা যদি দয়া করে আমাদের জানান। ধন্যবাদ!\nএই চিন্তা খুবই স্বাভাবিক। আজ প্রতিটি পরিবারে মা-বাবার যদি একটিই স্বপ্ন থাকে, তবে তা হল সন্তানের শিক্ষা। বাড়ি-গাড়ির কথা পরে আসে। ভারতবর্ষের মত দেশে সন্তানের পড়াশোনার জন্য এই ভাবনা, তাদের যথেষ্ট শিক্ষাদানের ভাবনা, এক মস্ত বড়ো শক্তি। সন্তানকে ভালো শিক্ষাদানের এই ভাবনা আরো বাড়ানো চাই। এই ব্যাপারে আরও সচেতনতা আসা প্রয়োজন।\nআমি মনে করি যে সমস্ত পরিবারে এই সচেতনতা আছে, তার সুফল স্কুলে শিক্ষকদের ওপর পড়ে, এমনকি বাচ্চাও শিক্ষার ব্যাপারে সচেতন হয়ে ওঠে। এজন্য আমি সমস্ত অভিভাবক ও মা-বাবাকে অনুরোধ করব যে বাচ্চাদের সঙ্গে স্কুলের কার্যক্রম সম্পর্কে যথেষ্ট সময় দিয়ে আলোচনা করুন। আর যদি কোনও বিষয় মনে হয় তো নিজেই স্কুলে গিয়ে শিক্ষকদের সঙ্গে আলোচনা করুন। এই নজরদারী আমাদের শিক্ষাক্ষেত্রের অনেক ত্রুটি কমাতে সাহায্য করবে। আর সবার অংশীদারীত্বে এটা অবশ্যই সম্ভব হবে। আমাদের দেশের প্রতিটি সরকার শিক্ষার ওপর গুরুত্ব দিয়েছেন এবং তাঁরা নিজের নিজের পদ্ধতিতে চেষ্টাও করেছেন। আর এটাও সত্যি যে দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে আমাদের মনোযোগ ছিল যে শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান তৈরি হোক, শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার বিস্তার ঘটুক, স্কুল-কলেজ তৈরি হোক, শিক্ষক-শিক্ষিকা নিয়োগ হোক, অনেক শিশু স্কুলে আসুক প্রভৃতি বিষয়ে। তো একপ্রকার শিক্ষাকে চতুর্দিকে ছড়িয়ে দেওয়ার প্রয়াস ছিল আমাদের প্রধান গুরুত্ব। আর এর প্রয়োজনও ছিল। কিন্তু এখন, শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা প্রসারের থেকেও বেশি গুরুত্ব শিক্ষার উন্নতির। শিক্ষা প্রসারের ক্ষেত্রে এক বড়ো কাজ আমরা করেছি। এখন আমাদের গুণগত শিক্ষার ওপর জোর দিতেই হবে। সাক্ষরতা অভিযানের মাধ্যমে ভালো শিক্ষা – এটাই আমাদের প্রধান লক্ষ্য হওয়া উচিত। এতদিন পরিকাঠামোর হিসাব-নিকাশ প্রয়োজন হত। এখন শিক্ষার সাফল্যের হিসাব নিকাশ করা প্রয়োজন। এতদিন পর্যন্ত স্কুলে কতজন শিক্ষার্থী এসেছে তার ওপর গুরুত্ব দেওয়া হত। এখন ছাত্র-ছাত্রীর সংখ্যার তুলনায় শিক্ষার গুণগত মানের ওপর জোর দিতে হবে। ভর্তি, ভর্তি, ভর্তি – এই মন্ত্র সারাক্ষণ জপ করা হত। কিন্তু এখন যে শিশু স্কুলে এসেছে, তাদের ভাল এবং যোগ্য শিক্ষা দেওয়ার ওপর আমাদের মনোনিবেশ করতে হবে। বর্তমান সরকারের বাজেট আপনারা দেখেছেন। সুশিক্ষার ওপরে জোর দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। এটা ঠিক যে, অনেক পথ চলা বাকি। তবে যদি আমরা ১২৫ কোটি দেশবাসী সিদ্ধান্ত নিই, তাহলে এই পথও আমরা অতিক্রম করতে পারব। তবে শর্মিলাজীর কথাটা সত্যি যে আমাদের নিজেদের চিন্তাধারাতেও আপাদমস্তক পরিবর্তন আনা বাঞ্ছনীয়।\nআপনারা নিশ্চয়ই লক্ষ করেছেন, এবার বাজেটে পরম্পরাগত ধারণার বাইরে গিয়ে কিছু কাজ করা হয়েছে। বাজেটের মধ্যে দশটি সরকারী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় এবং দশটি বেসরকারী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়কে সরকারী বন্ধন থেকে মুক্তি দেওয়ার কথা বলা হয়েছে এবং তাদের কাছে জানতে চাওয়া হয়েছে সর্বোত্তম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় হওয়ার জন্য তাদের সামনে কী কী চ্যালেঞ্জ রয়েছে! তাদের সম্পূর্ণ স্বাধীনতা দেওয়ার জন্য এই পরিকল্পনা করা হয়েছে। ভারতের বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলি বিশ্বের অন্যান্য বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলির সঙ্গে প্রতিযোগিতা করতে পারে, আর এরকম প্রতিযোগিতা করাও দরকার। এরই সঙ্গে শিক্ষা যেমন গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, তেমনই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় দক্ষতা। এই কারণে শিক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে টেকনোলজি খুব বড় ভূমিকা পালন করবে। দূর-শিক্ষার টেকনোলজি আমাদের শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থাকে আরও সহজ করবে। আর অদূর ভবিষ্যতে এর ফল বুঝতে পারব বলে আমার বিশ্বাস।\nবেশ কিছুদিন যাবৎ একটি বিষয় নিয়ে আমাকে কিছু মানুষ প্রশ্ন করছেন, কেউ কেউ mygov webportal–এ লিখছেন, কেউ কেউ Narendra Modi App–এ লিখছেন, আর এরমধ্যে বেশিরভাগই যুব সম্প্রদায়।\nমাননীয় প্রধানমন্ত্রী, নমস্কার! আমি বিজনোর থেকে মীণা কর্ণওয়াল বলছি। আজকের দিনে লেখাপড়ার সঙ্গে সঙ্গে খেলাধুলাতেও যুবকদের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ভূমিকা আছে। তাদের মধ্যে দলবদ্ধভাবে কাজ করার মানসিকতা, আর ভালো নেতৃত্বের গুণ থাকা দরকার যাতে তাদের সার্বিক বিকাশ সম্ভব হয়। এটা আমি আমার নিজের অভিজ্ঞতা থেকে বলছি, কেননা আমি নিজে ‘ভারত স্কাউটস্‌ অ্যান্ড গাইডস্‌’-এর সদস্য ছিলাম। আমার জীবনে তার এক বড়ো প্রভাব পড়েছে। আমি চাই আপনি অনেক বেশি সংখ্যক যুবকদের অনুপ্রাণিত করুন। আমি চাই সরকার অধিক থেকে অধিক সংখ্যক NCC, NSS এবং ভারত Scouts and Guide-কে উৎসাহিত করুক।\nআপনারা আমাকে এত প্রস্তাব পাঠিয়েছেন যে আমিও আপনাদের সঙ্গে কথা বলার আগে NCC, NSS, ভারত Scouts and Guides প্রভৃতি সংস্থার সঙ্গে কথা বলার জন্য মনস্থির করি। আপনাদের বারংবার অনুরোধে ও প্রস্তাবে আমি একটি বৈঠকের আয়োজন করেছিলাম, যাতে NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru যুবকেন্দ্রের প্রধানরা উপস্থিত ছিলেন। আমি যখন তাদের জিজ্ঞেস করলাম তারা এর আগে কবে একত্রে মিলিত হয়েছেন, তো তারা আমাকে জানান, দেশ স্বাধীন হওয়ার পর তারা প্রথমবার এই ধরনের বৈঠকে উপস্থিত হয়েছেন। এই কারণে আমি সর্বপ্রথম সেই সব যুবা বন্ধুদের অভিনন্দন জানাতে চাই, যাঁরা এই কাজ করার জন্য আমাকে অনুরোধ করেছেন। এর ফলে আমি এই বৈঠকের আয়োজন করেছিলাম, যা আমার খুব ভালো লেগেছে। তবে আমার মনে হয়, এই সংস্থাগুলির মধ্যে বোঝাপড়ার আবশ্যকতা আছে। প্রত্যেকে নিজের নিজের মতো অনেক কিছু করছে, কিন্তু যদি বিভিন্ন সংগঠন মিলিত ভাবে, সংগঠিত রূপে কাজ করে তো কত ভালোভাবে কাজ সম্পন্ন করতে পারে। কত বড়ো এদের বিস্তৃতি, কত পরিবার পর্যন্ত এরা পৌঁছবে। এদের ব্যপ্তি দেখে আমি খুব আশ্চর্যান্বিত হয়েছি। তাদের মধ্যে কিছু না কিছু করার উৎসাহ আমি লক্ষ করেছি। আর এটাতো ঠিক, যে আমি নিজে NCC ক্যাডেট ছিলাম। তাই আমি জানি যে এই সংগঠন থেকে কীভাবে এক নতুন দৃষ্টিভঙ্গী জন্ম নেয়, প্রেরণা পায় এবং এক রাষ্ট্রিয় একতার চিন্তাভাবনা সংগঠিত হয়। আমি তো অল্প বয়সেই লাভবান হয়েছি। তবে আমার মনে হয়, এই সব সংগঠনগুলিতে এক নতুন প্রাণ সঞ্চয় করা দরকার। এক নতুন শক্তি সৃষ্টি করা দরকার। এবার আমি তাদের সামনে এই ধরণের কিছু বিষয় তুলে ধরেছি। আমি তাদেরকে বলেছি, এই গরমের সময় আমাদের যুবাবন্ধুরা কেন জল সঞ্চয়ের কাজে অংশ গ্রহণ করবে না? আমরা চেষ্টা করে কত ব্লক, কত জেলাতে খোলা জায়গায় শৌচকাজ বন্ধ করতে পারি, খোলা জায়গায় শৌচকর্ম কীভাবে বন্ধ করা যায়? দেশকে সংগঠিত করতে কীরকম পরিকল্পনা গ্রহণ করা দরকার, আমাদের সকল সংগঠনের যুবকদের একটি সাধারণ জপমন্ত্র কী হতে পারে? ওদের সঙ্গে এরকমই কিছু কথাবার্তা হয়েছে।\nআমি আপনাদের অনুরোধ করব, আপনারা আমাকে বলুন, কিছু সঠিক পরামর্শ দিন যে এই যুব সংগঠনগুলির কার্যপদ্ধতির মধ্যে নতুন কী সংযোজন করা যেতে পারে। আমার নরেন্দ্র মোদী অ্যাপ-এ আপনারা লিখলে আমি সেটা উপযুক্ত জায়গায় পৌছে দেব আর আমার দৃঢ় বিশ্বাস, এই বৈঠক-এর পর সংগঠনগুলির কাজে গতি আসবে। আপনারাও এর সঙ্গে যুক্ত হওয়ার চেষ্টা করবেন এরকম পরিস্থিতি তৈরি হবে।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, আমাদের সবাইকে চিন্তা করতে বাধ্য করছে এরকম কিছু কথা এখন আমি বলব। আমি এটাকে আমাদের মধ্যে আলোড়ণ সৃষ্টিকারী বিষয়রূপে দেখি। আপনারা নিশ্চয়ই লক্ষ করেছেন যে আমাদের দেশে রাজনৈতিক পরিস্থিতি এমন এক পর্যায়ে পৌঁছেছে যে, বিগত কয়েকটি নির্বাচনে এই বিষয়ে অনেক কথাবার্তা হয়েছে – কোন পার্টি কতগুলি গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডার দেবে? ১২-টা না ৯-টা? নির্বাচনে এটা ছিল একটা মুখ্য বিষয়। সব রাজনৈতিক দল মনে করেছিলেন যে মধ্যবিত্ত সমাজের দৃষ্টি আকর্ষণ করার জন্য গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডার একটা গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয়। অন্যদিকে অর্থনীতিবিদ্‌রা গ্যাস সাবসিডি কম করার কথা বলেছিলেন। কয়েকটি কমিটিও গ্যাস সাবসিডি কম করার বিষয়ে তাদের প্রস্তাব রেখেছেন। এই কমিটিগুলির জন্য কয়েক কোটি টাকা খরচ হচ্ছিল, কিন্তু কাজের কাজ কিছুই হয়নি। এটা সবারই অভিজ্ঞতা। কিন্তু তা সত্ত্বেও এর বাইরে কিছু ভাবা হয়নি। আমার দেশবাসী, আজকে আপনাদের বলতে আমাদের আনন্দ হচ্ছে যে, আমরা একটি তৃতীয় রাস্তা বার করেছি। আর এই রাস্তা হচ্ছে জনতা-জনার্দ্দনের উপরই বিশ্বাস রাখা। কখনো কখনো আমাদের রাজনৈতিক নেতাদের নিজের থেকে নিজের লোকেদের ওপর বিশ্বাস করা উচিত। জনতা জনার্দনের ওপর বিশ্বাস রেখে আমি কথার কথা বলেছিলাম, আপনারা যদি বছরে ১৫০০ বা ২০০০ টাকার বোঝা সহ্য করতে পারেন, তাহলে গ্যাস সাবসিডি কেন ছেড়ে দিচ্ছেন না, যেটা কোনো গরীবের কাজে আসবে! আমি এই ধরনের কথা বলেছিলাম, কিন্তু আজকে আমি বলতে চাই, আমার দেশবাসীর ওপর আমার গর্ব হচ্ছে। এক কোটি পরিবার স্বেচ্ছায় গ্যাস সাবসিডি ছেড়ে দিয়েছেন। আর এই এক কোটি পরিবার ধনী নয়। আমি দেখছি, যারা সাবসিডি ছেড়েছেন, তাদের মধ্যে কেউ অবসরপ্রাপ্ত শিক্ষক, অবসরপ্রাপ্ত clerk, কৃষক, ছোটো দোকানদার – এই ধরনের মধ্যবিত্ত বা নিম্ন-মধ্যবিত্ত শ্রেণির পরিবার। আর একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য বিষয় লক্ষ করুন, গ্যাস সাবসিডি ছাড়ার জন্য মোবাইল ফোন অ্যাপ-এর সাহায্য নেওয়া যেতে পারত, অনলাইন-এ করতে পারতেন, টেলিফোনে মিস্‌ড কল করেও করতে পারতেন – এরকম অনেক উপায় ছিল। কিন্তু হিসেব করে দেখা গেছে যে এই এক কোটি পরিবার যাঁরা গ্যাস সাবসিডি ছেড়েছেন, তাদের মধ্যে ৮০ শতাংশেরও বেশি মানুষ ডিস্ট্রিবিউটরের কাছে গিয়ে লাইনে দাঁড়িয়ে থেকে লিখিত আবেদন করে গ্যাস সাবসিডি ছেড়েছেন।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, এটা খুব একটা ছোটো বিষয় নয়। সরকার যদি ট্যাক্স-এ অল্প কিছু ছাড় দেয়, তাহলে সপ্তাহব্যপী টিভি এবং সংবাদপত্রে সরকারের প্রশংসা শোনা যায়। আমাদের দেশে সাবসিডিকে একধরনের অধিকার বলে মানা হয়। কিন্তু এক কোটি পরিবার সাবসিডি ছেড়ে দিয়েছেন। আমি সবার আগে ঐ এক কোটি পরিবারকে শত শত প্রণাম জানাচ্ছি, অভিনন্দন জানাচ্ছি, কেননা তাঁরা রাজনৈতিক নেতাদের নতুনভাবে চিন্তা করতে বাধ্য করেছেন। বিশ্বের অর্থনীতিবিদ্‌রা, যাঁরা এটা করলে ওটা হবে, এই ধরনের আর্থিক সমীকরণ উপস্থাপনা করেন, এই ঘটনা তাঁদেরও চিন্তার বাইরে। এক কোটি পরিবারের সাবসিডি ছাড়া এবং তার বদলে এককোটি গরীব পরিবারের গ্যাস সিলিণ্ডার পাওয়ার বিষয়টি সত্যিই মনে রাখার মতো। এক কোটি পরিবারের সাবসিডি ছাড়ার ফলে যে পরিমান টাকা বাঁচানো যাচ্ছে, সেটা হয়তো বাইরে থেকে দেখলে খুবই সামান্য। যেটা অসামান্য বিষয়, সেটা হল জনগণের ওপর বিশ্বাস রেখে কাজ করলে কত সন্তুষ্টি পাওয়া যায়। আমি, বিশেষ করে সমস্ত রাজনীতিবিদ্‌দের অনুরোধ করব, তাঁদের বলব আমরা যেন সর্বক্ষেত্রে জনগণের ওপর বিশ্বাস রাখি। আপনারা নিশ্চয়ই কখনো চিন্তাও করেননি যে আমরা এই ধরনের সাফল্য পাব আর আমাদের এই অভিমুখে যাওয়া উচিৎ। আমার বারবার মনে হয় যে তৃতীয় এবং চতুর্থ বর্গের জন্য কেন ইন্টারভিউ করব। পরীক্ষা দিয়ে যে নম্বর পাঠিয়েছে, তার উপর আস্থা রাখুন। কখনও কখনও তো আমার মনে হয় কি, আমরা ঘোষণা করি, আজ রেলের এই রাস্তায় কোনও টিকিট পরীক্ষক থাকবেন না। দেশের জনগণের ওপর আস্থা রেখে দেখুন কী হয়! এই ধরনের অনেক পরীক্ষা-নিরীক্ষা আমরা করতে পারি। দেশের জনগণের ওপর আস্থা রাখলে আশাতীত ফল পাওয়া যেতে পারে। যাই হোক, এটাতো নিজস্ব মতামত। এটা কোনো সরকারী নিয়ম হতে পারে না। কিন্তু এই ধরনের একটা পরিবেশ তো আমরা তৈরি করতে পারি। আর এই পরিবেশ কোনো রাজনৈতিক নেতা তৈরি করছেন না, দেশের এককোটি পরিবার এই পরিবেশ সৃষ্টি করেছেন।\nরবি কর্কে নামে এক ভদ্রলোক আমাকে চিঠি লিখেছেন – “Good News everyday!” উনি লিখেছেন – দয়া করে আপনার আধিকারিকদের বলুন, প্রতিদিন কোনো একটি ভালো ঘটনার বিষয়ে প্রত্যেক খবরের কাগজ ও নিউজ চ্যানেল-এ পোস্ট করতে। সব ব্রেকিং নিউজই খারাপ খবর হয়। ১২৫ কোটি জনসংখ্যার এই দেশে আমাদের আশেপাশে কি ভালো কিছুই হচ্ছে না? দয়া করে এই অবস্থার পরিবর্তন করুন। শ্রীমান রবি খুব রাগ প্রকাশ করেছেন। কিন্তু আমার বিশ্বাস ও আমার উপর রাগ করছে না, বর্তমান অবস্থার উপর রাগ ব্যক্ত করছেন। আপনাদের নিশ্চয়ই মনে আছে ভারতের প্রাক্তণ রাষ্ট্রপতি ড: এ পি জে আবদুল কালাম সবসময় বলতেন, সংবাদপত্রের প্রথম পাতায় সব সময় আশাব্যঞ্জক খবর ছাপুন। তিনি বারবার এই কথা বলতেন। কিছুদিন আগে একটি খবরের কাগজের তরফ থেকে আমাকে চিঠি লিখে জানিয়েছেন যে সোমবার দিন ওরা কোনো নিরাশাব্যঞ্জক খবর ছাপবেন না। অর্থাৎ কেবলমাত্র আশাব্যঞ্জক খবরই ছাপবে। আজকাল আমি দেখছি কিছু টিভি চ্যানেল আশাব্যঞ্জক খবর প্রচারের জন্য কিছু সময় নির্দিষ্ট করেছেন। তাহলে এটা তো ঠিকই যে আজকাল আশাব্যঞ্জক খবর প্রকাশের একটি পরিবেশ তৈরি হয়েছে। আর সবাই চাইছেন সাধারণ মানুষ যেন সঠিক আর ভালো খবর পান। এটা ঠিক যে কোনো বিখ্যাত ব্যক্তিও যদি ভালো ভালো কথা বলেন, ভালো ভালো শব্দ চয়ন করেন, ভালোভাবে তা উপস্থাপনা করেন তার যে প্রভাব, তার থেকে বেশি প্রভাব লক্ষ্য করা যায় কোনো ভালো খবরের। ভালো খবর ভালো কাজ করার প্রেরণা যোগায়। এটা তো ঠিক, ভালোর ওপর গুরুত্ব দিলে খারাপের স্থান আপনা থেকেই কমে যাবে। যদি প্রদীপ জ্বালাই, তাহলে অন্ধকার দূর হবেই, হবেই, হবেই! হয়তো আপনারা জানেন, এই কারণে সরকারী তরফে একটি ওয়েবসাইট খোলা হয়েছে – ট্রান্সফর্মিং ইণ্ডিয়া – এই ওয়েবসাইট-এ আশাব্যঞ্জক খবর প্রকাশ করা হয়। এটা শুধু সরকারের নয়, সাধারণ মানুষ এমনকী আপনিও কোনো ভালো খবর এই পোর্টালে পাঠাতে পারেন। আপনিও এতে যোগদান করতে পারেন। রবিজী, আপনি ভালো পরামর্শ দিয়েছেন। কিন্তু দয়া করে আমার ওপর রাগ করবেন না। আমরা সবাই মিলে গঠনমূলক কাজ করার চেষ্টা করব, গঠনমূলক কথা বলার চেষ্টা করব, গঠনগত লক্ষ্যে পৌঁছনোর চেষ্টা করব।\nআমাদের দেশের বৈশিষ্ট্য কুম্ভমেলা। কুম্ভমেলা পর্যটক আকর্ষণের কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হতে পারে। বিশ্বের খুব কম লোকেরই জানা আছে যে এত দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে নদীর তীরবর্তী স্থানে কোটি কোটি মানুষ আসেন। শান্ত মনে, শান্ত পরিবেশে এই মেলা সম্পন্ন হয়। এই ঘটনা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক দৃষ্টিভঙ্গীতে, ইভেন্ট ম্যানেজমেন্টের দৃষ্টিভঙ্গিতে, সাধারণ মানুষের অংশীদারীত্বের দৃষ্টিভঙ্গীতে নিজেই এক খুব বড়ো নজির সৃষ্টি করে। বিগত কয়েকদিন ধরে আমি দেখছি যে, কিছু মানুষ সিংহস্ত কুম্ভের ছবি আপলোড করছে। আমি চাই যে ভারত সরকার ও রাজ্য সরকারের পর্যটন দপ্তর এই ছবিগুলির এক প্রতিযোগিতা আয়োজন করুন। আর লোকজনকে বলুন ভালো ভালো ফোটো তুলে আপলোড করতে। সাধারণ মানুষ জানতে পারবেন যে কুম্ভমেলার প্রতিটি কোণে কত বিভিন্ন রকমের ঘটনা ঘটে চলেছে – এক সুন্দর পরিবেশ তৈরি হয়ে যাবে। এই কাজ অবশ্যই করা সম্ভব। দেখুন, এই কথা ঠিক। মাঝে মধ্যপ্রদেশের মুখ্যমন্ত্রী আমার সঙ্গে দেখা করেছিলেন। তিনি বলছিলেন যে, আমরা স্বচ্ছতার ওপর বিশেষ জোর দিয়েছি, আর স্বচ্ছতা শুধু এই পরিসরে আটকে থাকুক, তা নয়, কুম্ভমেলা থেকে মানুষ স্বচ্ছতার বার্তা নিয়ে যাবেন এটাই তাঁরা চান। আমি মানি যে এই কুম্ভমেলা এক ধার্মিক এবং আধ্যাত্মিক মেলা। কিন্তু আমরা এটিকে এক সামাজিক মিলনক্ষেত্র হিসেবেও তৈরি করতে পারি। সাংস্কৃতিক ক্ষেত্র হিসেবেও গড়ে তুলতে পারি। সৎ সংকল্প, সৎ অভ্যাস গ্রামে গ্রামে পৌঁছে দেওয়ার এ এক সুযোগ হতে পারে। জলের প্রতি ভালোবাসা, জলের প্রতি ভরসা কীভাবে বাড়ানো যায়, জল সঞ্চয়ের বার্তা দেওয়ার জন্য কুম্ভমেলার ব্যবহার যতরকম ভাবে করা যায়, তা আমাদের করা উচিত।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, পঞ্চায়েত রাজের এই মহতী দিনে আমি আরও একবার আপনাদের সঙ্গে অবশ্যই মিলব, আপনাদের সবাইকে অনেক অনেক ধন্যবাদ। আর প্রতিবারের মতো আপনাদের মনের কথার সঙ্গে আমার মনের কথার এই যে অটুট সংযোগ – এই জন্য আমার আনন্দ। আরও একবার অনেক অনেক ধন্যবাদ!\nPG/DM/S….\n"

        "article": "\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, આપ સૌને નમસ્કાર..\nરજાઓમાં દરેક જણ કેટલાય કાર્યક્રમ બનાવે છે. અને રજાઓમાં કેરીની પણ મોસમ હોય છે, એટલે એવું પણ મન થાય છે કે, કેરીની મજા લઇએ. અને કયારેક એવું પણ મન થાય છે કે, બપોરે થોડો સમય ઊંઘવાની તક મળી જાય તો સારૂં. પરંતુ આ વખતની ભયંકર ગરમીએ ચારે બાજુ બધી મજા બગાડી નાખી છે. દેશમાં તેની ચિંતા થવાનું બહુ સ્વાભાવિક છે, અને તેમાં પણ જયારે સતત દુષ્કાળ પડે છે ત્યારે જળસંગ્રહનાં જે સ્થળો હોય છે તે પણ ઓછાં થઇ જાય છે. કોઇકોઇ વાર દબાણના કારણે કાંપના ભરાવાના કારણે પાણીની આવકનો જે પ્રવાહ હોય છે તેમાં અવરોધોના કારણે જળાશયોમાં પોતાની ક્ષમતા કરતાં ઓછું પાણી એકઠું થાય છે. દુષ્કાળના સામના માટે પાણીના સંકટથી રાહત માટે સરકારો પોતાના પ્રયાસો કરે એ તો ખરૂં જ. પરંતુ મે જોયું છે કે, નાગરિકો પણ બહુ સારા પ્રયાસો કરે છે. કેટલાંય ગામોમાં જાગૃતિ જોવા મળે છે અને પાણીનું મૂલ્ય શું છે એ તો જેમણે પાણીની તકલીફ સહી હોય છે તે જ જાણે છે. અને એટલે જ એવા સ્થળે પાણીની બાબતમાં એક સંવેદનશીલતા પણ હોય છે તથા કંઇને કંઇક કરવાની સક્રિયતા પણ હોય છે. થોડા દિવસ પહેલાં મને કોઇકે જણાવ્યું હતું કે, મહારાષ્ટ્રના એહમદનગર જિલ્લાની હિવરે બાજાર ગ્રામપંચાયત અને ત્યાંના ગ્રામજનોએ, પાણીને ગામના એક ખૂબ મોટા સંવેદનશીલ પ્રશ્નના રૂપમાં લઇને ઉકેલ્યો છે. જળસંચય કરવાનું ઇચ્છનારાં તો કેટલાં ગામ મળી જાય છે, પરંતુ તેમણે તો ખેડૂતો સાથે ચર્ચા વિચારણા કરીને પાક પદ્ધતિ જ બદલી નાખી છે. જે પાક સૌથી વધુ પાણીનો ઉપયોગ કરતા હતા, પછી એ શેરડી હોય, કેળાં હોય, એવા પાકોની ખેતી છોડવાનો નિર્ણય કર્યો છે. સાંભળવામાં આ બાબત બહુ સહેલી લાગે છે, પરંતુ તે એટલું સહેલું નથી. સૌએ સાથે મળીને કેટલો મોટો સંકલ્પ કર્યો હશે. ? ! કોઇ કારખાનેદાર પાણીનો વધારે ઉપયોગ કરતા હોય તેને કહીએ કે તમે કારખાનું બંધ કરી દો, કારણ કે, તમે વધારે પાણી વાપરો છો, તો પરિણામ શું આવસે તે આપ જાણો છો. પરંતુ જુઓ તો ખરા, આ મારા ખેડૂત ભાઇઓને ! તેમને લાગ્યું કે ભાઇ, શેરડી ઘણું પાણી લે છે. તો શેરડી છોડો. તેઓએ શેરડી છોડી દીધી. અને જેમાં પાણીની ઓછામાં ઓછી જરૂર પડે છે તેવા બાગાયત અને શાકભાજીની ખેતી પર જ બધા ચાલ્યા ગયા. તેઓએ ફુવારા, ડ્રીપ ઇરિગેશન-ટપકસિંચાઇ, વરસાદી પાણીનો સંગ્રહ, જળસંચય, એટલી બધી પહેલ કરી છે કે, આજે તે ગામ પાણીના સંકટનો સામનો કરવા માટે પોતાની જ તાકાત પર ઉભું થઇ ગયું છે. ઠીક છે, હું ભલે એક નાના એવા હિવરે બાજાર ગામની વાત કરૂં છું. પરંતુ એવાં કેટલાંય ગામો હશે. હું એવાં તમામ ગ્રામવાસીઓને પણ તેમના આ ઉત્તમ કામ માટે ખૂબખૂબ ધન્યવાદ આપું છું.\nમને કોઇએ જણાવ્યું કે, મધ્યપ્રદેશમાં દેવાસ જિલ્લામાં એક ગોરવા ગ્રામ પંચાયત છે. આ પંચાયતે પ્રયત્નો કરીને ખેત તલાવડીઓ બનાવવાનું અભિયાન ચલાવ્યું. લગભગ 27 ખેતતલાવડીઓ બનાવી અને તેના કારણે જમીનમાંના પાણીની સપાટીમાં વધારો થયો, પાણીનાં તળ ઊંચાં આવ્યાં. પાકને જયારે પણ પાણીની જરૂર પડી, પાણી મળ્યું અને તેઓની ઉપરછલ્લી ગણતરી જણાવી કે તેમના ખેતઉત્પાદનમાં લગભગ 20 ટકાનો વધારો થયો. આમ પાણી તો બચ્યું જ બચ્યું, પરંતુ જયારે પાણીનું તળ ઉપર આવે છે તો પાણીની ગુણવત્તામાં પણ મોટો સુધારો થાય છે. અને દુનિયામાં એવું કહેવાય છે કે, શુદ્ધ પીવાનું પાણી કુલ રાષ્ટ્રીય ઉત્પાદનનું કારણ બને છે. આરોગ્યનું કારણ તો બને છે જ. કોઇકોઇ વાર તો લાગે છે કે, ભારત સરકારે જયારે ટ્રેન દ્વારા લાતુરને પાણી પહોંચાડ્યું, તે દુનિયા માટે એક સમાચાર બની ગયા. એ વાત ખરી છે કે, જે ઝડપે રેલવેએ આ કામ કર્યું એ અભિનંદનને પાત્ર છે, પરંતુ પેલા ગામવાળા પણ એટલા જ અભિનંદનને પાત્ર છે. હું તો કહીશ, રેલવે કરતાં પણ વધુ અભિનંદનને પાત્ર છે. પરંતુ એવી અનેક યોજનાઓ કે જે નાગરિકો દ્વારા ચાલે છે. તે કયારેય સામી નથી આવતી. સરકારની સારી બાબતો તો કોઇકોઇ વાર સામે આવી પણ જાય છે, પરંતુ કયારેક આપણે આપણી આજુબાજુ જોઇશું તો ધ્યાનમાં આવશે કે દુષ્કાળની સામે લોકો કેવી કેવી રીતે, નવી નવી રીતો – પદ્ધતિઓથી સમસ્યાના ઉકેલનો પ્રયાસ કરતા રહે છે.\nમાણસનો સ્વભાવ છે, ભલેને કેટલીયે મુશ્કેલીઓ વચ્ચેથી પસાર થતો હોય, પરંતુ કયાંયથી કોઇ સારા સમાચાર આવી જાય છે. તો જાણે પૂરૂં સંકટ દુર થઇ ગયું હોય એવો અનુભવ કરે છે. આ વર્ષે વરસાદ 106 ટકાથી 110 ટકા થવાની સંભાવનાની જાણકારી જયારથી જાહેર થઇ છે, જાણે એક બહુ મોટો શાંતિનો સંદેશ આવી ગયો હોય તેમ લાગે છે. હજી તો વરસાદ આવવાને વાર છે, પણ સારા વરસાદના સમાચાર પણ એક નવી ચેતના લઇ આવ્યા. પરંતુ મારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ… સારો વરસાદ થશે એ સમાચાર જેટલો આનંદ આપે છે, તેટલી જ આપણા બધાં માટે એક તક પણ આપે છે, એક પડકાર પણ ફેંકે છે. શું આપણે ગામેગામ પાણી બચાવવા માટે, અત્યારથી જ એક અભિયાન ચલાવી શકીએ છીએ ? ખેડૂતોને માટીની જરૂર પડે છે. ખેતરમાં તે પાક ઉગાડવામાં કામ આવે છે. આ વખતે આપણે ગામનાં તળાવોમાંથી માટી કાઢીને ખેતરોમાં કેમ ના લઇ જઇએ ? તેનાથી ખેતરની જમીન પણ સારી થશે અને તળાવોની જળસંગ્રહ ક્ષમતા પણ વધી જશે. કયારેક સિમેન્ટની થેલીઓમાં, કયારેય ખાતરની ખાલી થેલીઓમાં, પથરા અને માટી ભરીને જયાંથી પાણી આવવાનો માર્ગ છે તે પાણીને રોકી શકાય કે નહીં ? પાંચ દિવસ પાણી રોકાશે, સાત દિવસ પાણી રોકાશે, તો પાણી જમીનમાં ઉતરશે. તો જમીનમાં પાણીનાં તળ ઉંચાં આવશે. આપણા કૂવાઓમાં પાણી આવશે. જેટલું બની શકે તેટલું પાણી રોકવું જોઇએ. વરસાદનું પાણી, ગામનું પાણી ગામમાં રહેશે. આપણે જો સંકલ્પ કરીને, કંઇક ને કંઇક કરીએ તો સામૂહિક પ્રયત્નોથી આ સંભવ છે. તો આજ ભલે પાણીનું સંકટ હોય, દુષ્કાળની સ્થિતિ હોય, પરંતુ આગામી મહિના દોઢ મહિનાનો આપણી પાસે સમય છે. અને હું તો હંમેશા કહું છું, કયારેય આપણે પોરબંદર મહાત્મા ગાંધીના જન્મસ્થાન પર જઇએ તો ત્યાં જે અલગઅલગ સ્થાન આપણે જોઇએ છીએ તેમાં એક જગ્યા એ પણ જોવા જેવી છે કે, વરસાદનું પાણી બચાવવા માટે ઘરની નીચે કેવા પ્રકારના બસો બસો વર્ષ જૂના ટાંકા બનાવેલા છે અને તેમાં પાણી કેટલું શુદ્ધ રહે છે.\nકોઇ શ્રીમાન કુમારકૃષ્ણા છે, તેમણે માય ગોવ પર લખ્યું છે અને એક પ્રકારે જિજ્ઞાસા પણ વ્યકત કરી છે. તેઓ કહે છે કે શું આપણી હયાતિમાં ગંગાસફાઇનું અભિયાન કયારેય સંભવ થશે ખરૂં ? તેમની ચિંતા બહુ સ્વાભાવિક છે. કેમ કે, લગભગ 30 વરસથી આ કામ ચાલી રહ્યું છે. કેટલીયે સરકારો આવી, ઘણી યોજનાઓ બની, ઢગલાબંધ ખર્ચ પણ થયો, એટલે તેના કારણે ભાઇ કુમારકૃષ્ણા જેવા દેશના કરોડો લોકોના મનમાં આ સવાલ ઉભો થવો બહુ સ્વાભાવિક છે. જે લોકો ધાર્મિક આસ્થાવાળા છે, તેમના માટે ગંગા મોક્ષદાયિની છે. આ મહાત્મ્યને તો હું સ્વીકાર કરીશ જ, પરંતુ તેનાથી વધારે મને લાગે છે કે, ગંગા જીવનદાયિની છે. ગંગાથી આપણને રોટી મળે છે. ગંગાથી આપણને રોજી મળે છે. ગંગાથી આપણને જીવવાની એક નવી તાકાત મળે છે. જેમ ગંગા વહે છે તેમ દેશની આર્થિક પ્રવૃત્તિઓને પણ એક નવો વેગ આપે છે. એક ભગીરથે આપણે ગંગા તો લાવીને આપી, પરંતુ બચાવવા માટે કરોડો કરોડો ભગીરથોની જરૂર છે. લોકભાગીદારી વિના આ કામ સફળ થઇ શકે જ નહીં. અને એટલા માટે આપણે બધાંએ, સફાઇ માટે, સ્વચ્છતા માટે, પરિવર્તનના પ્રતિનિધિ બનવું પડશે, વારેવારે વાતને દોહરાવવી પડશે, કહેવી પડશે. સરકાર તરફથી ઘણા બધા પ્રયાસો કરાઇ રહ્યા છે. ગંગાના કિનારે જે જે રાજયો આવેલાં છે, તે રાજયોનો પણ ભરપૂર સહયોગ લેવા પ્રયાસો થઇ રહ્યા છે. સામાજિક, સ્વૈચ્છિક સંગઠનોને પણ જોડવાનો પ્રયાસ થઇ રહ્યો છે. પટની સપાઇ અને ઔદ્યોગિક પ્રદૂષણ રોકવાના પણ અનેક પગલાં ભર્યાં છે. દરરોજ મોટા પ્રમાણમાં નાળાં વાટે ઘન કચરો વહીને ગંગાની અંદર ઠલવાય છે. આવો કચરો સાફ કરવા માટે વારાણસી, અલ્હાબાદ, કાનપુર, પટણા વગેરે સ્થાનો પર ટ્રેશ સ્કીમર પાણીમાં તરતાં તરતાં કચરો સાફ કરવાનું કામ કરે છે. બધી સ્થાનિક સ્વરાજની સંસ્થાઓને આ મશીનો પૂરાં પાડવામાં આવ્યા છે અને આગ્રહ કરાયો છે કે, તેમને સતત ચલાવે અને ત્યાંથી કચરો સાફ કરતા જાય. અને વીતેલા દિવસોમાં મને જણાવવામાં આવ્યું છે કે, ત્યાં બહુ સારી રીતે પ્રયાસ થાય છે. ત્યાં તો રોજનો ત્રણથી 11 ટન સુધી કચરો કાઢવામાં આવે છે. તો આ બાબત તો ખરી છે જ કે આટલા મોટા પ્રમાણમાં ગંદકી વધતી અટકી જ રહી છે. આગામી દિવસોમાં બીજાં સ્થાનો ઉપર પણ ટ્રેશ સ્કીમર ગોઠવવાની યોજના છે. અને તેના લાભનો ગંગા તથા યમુના તટના લોકોને જલદી અનુભવ પણ થશે. ઔદ્યોગિક પ્રદૂષણ પર નિયંત્રણ માટે પલ્પ એન્ડ પેપર, ડીસ્ટીલરી અને ખાંડ ઉદ્યોગ સાથે એક કાર્યયોજના તૈયાર થઇ ગઇ છે. કંઇક અંશે લાગુ થવાનું શરૂ પણ થઇ ગયું છે. તેનાં પણ સારાં પરિણામ આવશે એવું અત્યારે તો મને લાગી રહ્યું છે.\nમને એ વાતની ખુશી છે કે, મને જણાવવામાં આવ્યું છે તે મુજબ ઉત્તરાખંડ અને ઉત્તરપ્રદેશમાં જે ડીસ્ટીલરી માંથી જે કચરો નીકળતો હતો તે કેટલાક અધિકારીઓએ મને જણાવ્યા અનુસાર સ્હેજ પણ પ્રવાહી સ્વરૂપે ન નીકળે તે દિશામાં એમણે સફળતા મેળવી લીધી છે. પલ્પ એન્ડ પેપર ઉદ્યોગમાંથી જે કચરો અથવા બ્લેક લિકર નીકળવાનું લગભગ સંપૂર્ણપણે બંધ થઇ ગયું છે. આ બધા એ બાબતના સંકેત છે કે, આપણે યોગ્ય દિશામાં આગળ વધી રહ્યા છીએ અને જાગૃતિ પણ વધી છે. અને મેં જોયું છે કે, કેવળ ગંગા કિનારાના જ નહીં, દૂરસુદૂર દક્ષિણની પણ કોઇ વ્યકિત મળે છે તો ચોક્કસ કહે છે કે સાહેબ, ગંગા સફાઇ તો થશેને ? તો આ જ, જે જનસામાન્યની આસ્થા છે, તે ગંગા સફાઇમાં જરૂર સફળતા અપાવશે. ગંગા સ્વચ્છતા માટે લોકો દાન પણ આપી રહ્યાં છે. એક બહુ સારી રીતે આ વ્યવસ્થાને ચલાવાઇ રહી છે.\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, આજે 24 એપ્રિલ છે. ભારતમાં તેને પંચાયતીરાજ દિવસના રૂપમાં મનાવવામાં આવે છે. આજના દિવસે આપણા દેશમાં પંચાયતીરાજ વ્યવસ્થાનો આરંભ થયો હતો. અને આજે ધીરેધીરે પૂરા દેશમાં પંચાયતીરાજ વ્યવસ્થા આપણી લોકતાંત્રિક રાજવ્યવસ્થાના એક મહત્વના એકમના રૂપમાં સફળતાપૂર્વક કામ કરી રહી છે.\n14 એપ્રિલે બાબા સાહેબ આંબેડકરની 125મી જયંતિ આપણે ઉજવી રહ્યા હતા. અને આજે 24 એપ્રિલે પંચાયતીરાજ દિવસ મનાવી રહ્યા છીએ. આ એક એવો સુભગ સંયોગ હતો કે જે મહાપુરૂષે આપણને ભારતનું બંધારણ આપ્યું, તેમના જન્મદિવસથી લઇને 24 તારીખ, કે જે બંધારણની સૌથી મજબૂત કડી છે, તે આપણું ગામ – એમ બન્નેને જોડવાની પ્રેરણા આપે છે. અને એટલા માટે રાજય સરકારોના સહયોગથી ભારત સરકારે 14 એપ્રિલથી 24 એપ્રિલ, 10 દિવસ ગ્રામોદયથી ભારતોદય અભિયાન ચલાવ્યું. 14 એપ્રિલે, બાબાસાહેબ આંબેડરજીના જન્મદિવસે, મને બાબાસાહેબ આંબેડકરના જન્મસ્થાન મહૂ જવાની તક મળી તે મારૂં સૌભાગ્ય હતું. તે પવિત્ર ધરતીને નમન કરવાની મને તક મળી. અને આજે 24 તારીખે હું ઝારખંડમાં કે જયાં આપણા અધિકત્તમ આદિવાસી ભાઇઓ-બહેનો રહે છે તે પ્રદેશમાં જઇને પંચાયતીરાજ દિવસ મનાવવાનો છું. અને બપોરે 3 વાગ્યે ફરી એકવાર પંચાયતીરાજ દિવસ નિમિત્તે હું દેશની બધી પંચાયતો સાથે વાતચીત કરવાનો છું. આ અભિયાને જાગૃતિનું એક બહુ મોટું કામ કર્યું છે. હિંદુસ્તાનના દરેક ખૂણામાં ગામના સ્તરે લોકતાંત્રિક સંસ્થાઓ કેવી રીતે મજબૂત બને ?\nગામ પોતે જ કેવી રીતે સ્વનિર્ભર બને ? ગામ પોતે જ પોતાના વિકાસની યોજના કેવી રીતે બનાવે ? આંતરમાળખાનું પણ મહત્વ હોય, સામાજિક માળખાનું પણ મહત્વ હોય. ગામમાં બાળકો ભણવાનું અધવચ્ચે છોડી ના દે, “બેટી બચાવો, બેટી ભણાવો” અભિયાન સફળતાપૂર્વક ચાલે. દીકરીનો જન્મદિવસ ગામનો મહોત્સવ બનવો જોઇએ. કેટલીયે એવી યોજનાઓ છે. કેટલાંક ગામોમાં તો ભોજન દાનના કાર્યક્રમો થયા. હિન્દુસ્તાનના આટલાં બધાં ગામોમાં કદાચ એક સાથે આટલા વિવિધ કાર્યક્રમો 10 દિવસ ચાલ્યા હોય એવું બહુ ઓછી વાર બને છે. હું બધી રાજય સરકારોને, ગામોના સરપંચોને આ બાબત માટે અભિનંદન આપું છું. આપે ખૂબ જ મૌલિક રીતે, નવિનતા સાથે આ પૂરા મોકાને ગામની ભલાઇ માટે, ગામના વિકાસ માટે, લોકતંત્રની મજબૂતાઇ માટેના એક મોકામાં પરિવર્તિત કર્યો. ગામોમાં જે જાગૃતિ આવી છે, તે જ તો ભારત ઉદયની ગેરંટી છે. ભારત ઉદયનો આધાર ગ્રામ ઉદય જ છે અને એટલા માટે ગ્રામ ઉદય ઉપર આપણે બધાં જોર આપતાં રહીશું તો ઇચ્છિત પરિણામ મેળવીને જ રહીશું. મુંબઇથી શર્મિલા ઘારપૂરે, આપે મને ફોન કોલ પર આપની ચિંતા વ્યકત કરી છે.\n“પ્રધાનમંત્રી નમસ્કાર ! હું મુંબઇથી શર્મિલા ઘારપુરે બોલું છું. શાળા કોલેજોમાં શિક્ષણ વિષે મારો આપને એક સવાલ છે. છેલ્લાં ઘણાં વર્ષોથી શિક્ષણ ક્ષેત્રે સુધારાની જરૂર જોવા મળી છે. જેમ કે, પૂરતી શાળાઓ અથવા કોલેજો ન હોવી કે પછી શિક્ષણમાં ગુણવત્તા ન હોવી. એવું જોવા મળે છે કે, બાળકો પોતાનું શિક્ષણ પૂરૂંયે કરી લે છે, તો પણ તેમને મોટાભાગે પાયાની બાબતો વિષે ખબર નથી હોતી. તેના લીધે આપણાં બાળકો દુનિયાની દોડમાં પાછળ રહી જાય છે. આ વિષે આપના શા વિચારો છે અને આપ આ ક્ષેત્રે કેવી રીતે તેમાં સુધારો લાવવા ઇચ્છો છો, તેના વિષે કૃપા કરીને અમને જણાવશો”. ધન્યવાદ.\nઆ ચિંતા બહુ સ્વાભાવિક છે. આજે દરેક પરિવારમાં મા-બાપનું જો કોઇ પહેલું સપનું રહેતું હોય, તો તે બાળકોના સારા શિક્ષણનું રહે છે. ઘર, ગાડી, બધાંનો પછી વિચાર આવે છે. અને ભારત જેવા દેશ માટે જન મનની આ જે ભાવના છે તે બહુ મોટી તાકાત છે. બાળકોને ભણાવવાં અને સારૂં ભણાવવું સારૂં શિક્ષણ મળે તેની ચિંતા થવી હજી વધવી જોઇએ. અને વધુ જાગૃતિ આવવી જોઇએ. અને હું માનું છું કે, જે પરિવારોમાં આ જાગૃતિ હોય છે, તેની અસર શાળાઓ ઉપર પણ પડે છે. શિક્ષકો ઉપર પણ પડે છે. અને બાળક પણ જાગૃત થતું જાય છે કે, હું શાળામાં આ કામ માટે જાઉં છું. અને એટલા માટે હું બધા વાલીઓને, મા-બાપને સૌથી પહેલાં એ આગ્રહ કરીશ કે શાળામાં થઇ રહેલી પ્રવૃત્તિઓ વિષે બાળક સાથે વિસ્તારપૂર્વક સમય આપીને વાતો કરે. અને જો કોઇ વાત ધ્યાનમાં આવે તો જાતે શાળામાં જઇને શિક્ષકો સાથે વાત કરે. આ જે તકેદારી છે, તે પણ આપણી શિક્ષણ વ્યવસ્થામાંથી કેટલીયે બુરાઇઓને ઓછી કરી શકે છે. અને લોકભાગીદારીથી તો આ ચોક્કસ થવાનું જ છે. આપણા દેશમાં બધી સરકારોએ શિક્ષણ ઉપર ભાર મૂક્યો છે. અને દરેક સરકારે પોત-પોતાની રીતે પ્રયાસો પણ કર્યા છે. અને એ પણ સાચું છે કે, સારા એવા સમય સુધી આપણું ધ્યાન એ બાબત પર જ રહયું કે શિક્ષણ સંસ્થાઓ ઉભી થાય, શિક્ષણ વ્યવસ્થાનો વિસ્તાર થાય. શાળાઓ બને, કોલેજો બને, શિક્ષકોની ભરતી થાય, વધુમાં વધુ બાળકો શાળાએ આવે. તો એક રીતે, શિક્ષણને ચારે તરફ ફેલાવવાનો પ્રયાસ એ પ્રાથમિકતા રહી. અને તે જરૂરી પણ હતું. પરંતુ હવે જેટલું મહત્વ ફેલાવાનું છે તેનાથી પણ વધુ મોટું મહત્વ આપણા શિક્ષણમાં સુધારાનું છે. વિસ્તરણનું એક બહુ મોટું કામ આપણે કરી ચૂક્યા છીએ. હવે આપણે ગુણવત્તાયુક્ત શિક્ષણ પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રીય કરવું જ પડશે. સાક્ષરતા અભિયાનથી હવે સારૂં શિક્ષણ એ આપણી પ્રાથમિકતા બનાવવી પડશે. અત્યાર સુધી ગણતરી ખર્ચની થતી હતી, હવે આપણે ઉત્પન્ન શું થયું તેના પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રીત કરવું પડશે. અત્યાર સુધી શાળામાં કેટલા આવ્યા તેના પર જોર આપતા હતા, જવે શાળાકરણથી વધારે શીખવવા પર આપણે જોર આપવું પડસે. પ્રવેશ, પ્રવેશ, પ્રવેશ – મંત્ર સતત ગુંજતો રહ્યો, પરંતુ હવે જે બાળકો શાળામાં પહોંચી ગયાં છે, તેમને સારૂં શિક્ષણ, યોગ્ય શિક્ષણ, તેના પર જ આપણે ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રિત કરવું પડશે. વર્તમાન સરકારનું અંદાજપત્ર પણ તમે જોયું હશે. સારા શિક્ષણ પર ભાર આપવાનો પ્રયાસ થઇ રહ્યો છે. એ વાત ખરી છે કે, બહુ લાંબી મઝલ કાપવાની છે. પરંતુ જો આપણે સવાસો કરોડ દેશવાસીઓ નક્કી કરીએ, તો આ લાંબી મઝલ પણ કપાઇ શકે છે. પરંતુ શર્મિલાજીની વાત સાચી છે કે, આપણામાં ધરમૂળથી સુધારો લાવવાની જરૂર છે.\nઆ વખતે અંદાજપત્રમાં તમે જોયું હશે કે, ચીલો ચાતરીને કામ કરવામાં આવ્યું છે. અંદાજપત્રમાં, દસ સરકારી યુનિવર્સિટી અને દસ ખાનગી યુનિવર્સિટીઓને સરકારી બંધનોથી મુક્તિ આપવા માટે અને પડકારરૂપ માર્ગ પર આવવા માટે તેમને કહ્યું છે કે, આવો, આપ સૌથી ટોચની યુનિવર્સીટી બનવા માટે શું કરવા ઇચ્છો છો તે જણાવો. તેઓને પૂરી આઝાદી આપવાના આશયથી આ યોજના ઘડવામાં આવી છે. ભારતની યુનિવર્સિટીઓ પણ વૈશ્વિક સ્પર્ધા કરનારી યુનિવર્સીટી બની શકે છે. બનાવવી પણ જોઇએ.. તેની સાથેસાથે જેટલું મહત્વ શિક્ષણનું છે, તેટલું જ મહત્વ કૌશલ્યનું છે. તે જ રીતે શિક્ષણમાં ટેકનોલોજી પણ ખૂબ મોટી ભૂમિકા ભજવશે. દૂર અંતર શિક્ષણ અને ટેકનોલોજી આપણા શિક્ષણને સરળ પણ બનાવશે. અને બહુ નજીકના ભવિષ્યમાં તેનાં પરિણામો નજરે ચડશે તેવો મને વિશ્વાસ છે.\nઘણા લાંબા વખતથી લોકો મને એક વિષય પર પૂછતાં રહે છે. કેટલાક લોકો વેબપોર્ટલ માય ગોવ પર લખે છે. કેટલાક લોકો મને નરેન્દ્ર મોદી એપ્પ પર લખે છે, અને મોટાભાગના આ નવયુવાનો લખે છે.\n“પ્રધાનમંત્રી નમસ્કાર ! હું મોના કર્ણવાલ બોલું છું. બિજનૌરથી.. આજના યુગમાં યુવાનો માટે અભ્યાસની સાથે સાથે ખેલકૂદનું પણ ઘણું મહત્વ છે. તેમનામાં સંઘભાવના હોવી જોઇએ અને સારા નેતા હોવાનો ગુણ પણ હોવો જોઇએ. જેથી તેમનો સર્વાંગી વિકાસ થાય. આ હું મારા પોતાના અનુભવથી કહી રહી છું. કારણ કે, હું પોતે પણ ભારતની સ્કાઉટ એન્ડ ગાઇડમાં રહી ચૂકી છું. અને તેની મારા જીવનમાં બહુ સારી અસર પડી છે. હું ઇચ્છું છું કે, આપ વધુમાં વધુ યુવાનોને પ્રોત્સાહિત કરો. હું ઇચ્છું છું કે, સરકાર પણ વધુમાં વધુ એન.સી.સી., એન.એસ.એન., અને ભારત સ્કાઉટ એન્ડ ગાઇડ્સને પ્રોસ્તાહિત કરે.\nતમે લોકો મને આટલાં સૂચનો મોકલતાં રહેતાં હતાં. તો એક દિવસ મને પણ થયું કે, હું આપ લોકોની સાથે વાત કરૂં, તે પહેલાં હું બધાં સાતે વાતચીત કરૂં. તો આપલોકોનું જ દબાણ હતું, તમારા જ લોકોના સૂચનો હતાં. તેનું પરિણામ એ આવ્યું કે મેં હજી હમણાં જ આવી એક મીટીંગ બોલાવી. જેમાં એનસીસીના વડા હતા, એનએસએસના વડા હતા, સ્કાઉટ એન્ડ ગાઇડ્સના વડા હતા, રેડક્રોસના હતા, નહેરૂ યુવા કેન્દ્રના હતા. અને મેં જયારે તેમને પૂછયું કે, પહેલા કયારે ભેગા મળ્યા હતા ? તો તેઓએ કહ્યું કે, ના-ના ભાઇ, અમારી તો દેશ આઝાદ થયા પછી આ પ્રકારની પહેલી મીટીંગ યોજાઇ છે. તો સૌ પહેલાં તો હું તે યુવા મિત્રોને અભિનંદન આપું છું કે, જેમણે મને દબાણ કર્યું. આ બધાં કામોની બાબતમાં અને તેનું જ આ પરિણામ છે કે, મેં મીટીંગ બોલાવી. અને મને લાગે છે કે, હું બધાંને મળ્યો તે સારૂં થયું. બહુ સંકલનની જરૂર જણાઇ મને. પોત-પોતાની રીતે ઘણું બધું થઇ રહયું છે. પરંતુ તો સામૂહિકરૂપે, સંગઠિત થઇને આપણા જુદાજુદા પ્રકારના સંગઠનો કામ કરે. તો કેટલું મોટું પરિણામ આપી શકે છે. !! અને કેટલો બહોળો તેમનો ફેલાવો છે. !! કેટલા પરિવારો સુધી તેમની પહોંચ છે. !! તેમનો વ્યાપ જોઇને મને તો બહુ મોટી ધરપત થઇ. અને તેમનો ઉમંગ પણ ઘણો હતો. કંઇકને કંઇક કરવું હતું. અને એ વાત પણ સાચી છે કે, હું પોતે તો એનસીસીનો કેડેટ રહી ચૂક્યો છું. એટલે મને ખબર છે કે, આવાં સંગઠનો દ્વારા એક નવી દ્રષ્ટિ મળે છે. પ્રેરણા મળે છે. એક રાષ્ટ્રીય દ્રષ્ટિકોણ પાંગરે છે. મને તો બાળપણમાં જ તે લાભ મળ્યો છે જ અને હું એ પણ માનું છું કે, આ સંગઠનોનાં એક નવો પ્રાણ પૂરવો જોઇએ, નવી તાકાત સિંચવી જોઇએ. આ વખતે મેં તેમની સામે કેટલાક વિષય રાખેલા છે. મેં તેમને કહ્યું છે કે, ભાઇ, આ મોસમમાં જળસંચયનું બહુ મોટું કામ આપણા યુવાનો, બધા સંગઠનો કેમ ના કરે ? ! આપણે લોકો પ્રયાસ કરીને કેટલા તાલુકા, કેટલા જિલ્લામાં ખુલ્લામાં શૌચક્રિયા બંધ કરાવી શકીએ ? ! ઓપન ડીફેકશન ફ્રી કેવી રીતે કરી શકીએ ? ! દેશને જોડવા માટે એવા કયા કયા કાર્યક્રમોની રચના કરી શકીએ ? ! આપણાં બધાં સંગઠનોનાં સર્વસામાન્ય યુવા-ગીત શું હોઇ શકે ? ઘણીબધી વાતો તેઓની સાથે થઇ છે.\nહું આજે આપને પણ આગ્રહ કરૂં છું, આપ પણ મને જણાવો, એકદમ ચોક્કસ સૂચન કરો કે, આપણાં અનેક યુવા સંગઠનો ચાલે છે. તેમની કાર્યશૈલી, કાર્યક્રમમાં કઇ કઇ નવી બાબતો જોડી શકીએ ? મારા નરેન્દ્ર મોદી એપ્પ પર તમે લખશો, તો હું યોગ્ય જગ્યાએ પહોંચાડી દઇશ. અને હું માનું છું કે, આ મીટીંગ પછી તેમનામાં સારી એવી ગતિ આવશે. આવું મને તો લાગી રહ્યું છે અને આપને પણ તેની સાથે જોડાવાનું મન થશે. એવી સ્થિતિ તો બની જ જશે.\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, આજે આપણને બધાંને વિચારવા માટે મજબૂર કરે એવી વાત મારે તમને કહેવી છે. હું તેને આપણને લોકોને હચમચાવી દેનારી વાતના રૂપમાં પણ જોઉં છું. તમે જોયું હશે કે, આપણા દેશની રાજનૈતિક સ્થિતિ એવી છે કે, પાછલી કેટલીયે ચૂંટણીઓમાં એ બાબતની ચર્ચા થયા કરતી હતી કે, કયો પક્ષ ગેસના કેટલા સિલિન્ડર આપશે ? 12 બાટલા કે 9 બાટલા ? ચૂંટણીનો આ બહુ મોટો મુદ્દો બની રહેતો હતો. અને દરેક રાજકીય પક્ષને લાગતું હતું કે, મધ્યમવર્ગના સમાજ સુધી જો ચૂંટણીની દ્રષ્ટિએ પહોંચવું હોય તો ગેસના બાટલાનો બહુ મોટો મુદ્દો છે. બીજી તરફ અર્થશાસ્ત્રીઓ દબાણ કરતા રહેતા હતા કે, સબસીડી ઓછી કરો. અને તેના કારણે અનેક સમિતિઓ બેસતી હતી, જેમાં ગેસની સબસીડી ઘટાડવાની બહુ મોટી દરખાસ્તો આવતી હતી, સૂચનો આવતાં હતાં. આ સમિતિઓ પાછળ કરોડો રૂપિયાનો ખર્ચ થતો હતો. પરંતુ વાત ત્યાંની ત્યાં જ રહી જતી હતી. આ અનુભવ બધાંનો છે. પરંતુ તેની બહાર કયારેય વિચારમાં ન્હોતું આવ્યું.\nમારા દેશવાસીઓ, આજે આપ સૌને મારો હિસાબ આપતાં મને આનંદ થાય છે કે, મેં ત્રીજો જ માર્ગ અપનાવ્યો. અને તે માર્ગ હતો જનતા જનાર્દન પર ભરોસો મૂકવાનો. કોઇકોઇ વાર અમારે રાજનેતાઓએ પોતાની જાત કરતાં પોતાનાંનો ભરોસો કરવો જોઇએ. મેં જનતા જનાર્દન પર ભરોસો મૂકીને એમ જ વાતવાતમાં કહ્યું હતું કે, જો તમે વરસના પંદરસો બે હજાર રૂપિયાના ખર્ચનો બોજો સહન કરી શકો છો, તો તમે ગેસ સબસીડી શા માટે છોડી નથી દેતા ? કોઇ ગરીબને કામ આવશે. મેં એમ જ વાત કરી હતી. પરંતુ આજ હું ભારે ગર્વથી કહી શકું છું. મને ગર્વ થઇ રહ્યો છે. મારા દેશવાસીઓ પર. એક કરોડ પરિવારોએ સ્વેચ્છાએ પોતાની ગેસ સબસીડી પરત સોંપી દીધી. અને આ એક કરોડ પરિવાર અમીર નથી. હું જોઇ રહ્યો છું, કોઇ નિવૃત્ત શિક્ષક છે, નિવૃત્ત કલાર્ક, કોઇ ખેડૂત, કોઇ નાની એવી દુકાન ચલાવનાર, એવા મધ્યમવર્ગ, નિમ્ન મધ્યમવર્ગના પરિવારો છે. જેમણે સબસીડી છોડી છે. બીજી વિશેષતા જૂઓ કે, સબસીડી છોડવા માટે મોબાઇલ ફોનની એપથી કરી શકતા હતા. ઓનલાઇન કરી શકતા હતા. ટેલીફોન પર મિસ્ડ કોલ કરીને છોડી શકતા હતા, ઘણી રીતો હતો. પરંતુ ગણતરી કરી તો ખબર પડી કે, આ એક કરોડ પરિવારોમાં 80 ટકાથી વધુ એ લોકો હતા, જે પોતે વિતરકને ત્યાં ખુદ ગયા, કતારમાં ઉભા રહ્યા અને લેખિતમાં આપીને તેમણે પોતાની સબસીડી જતી કરી.\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, નાની બાબત નથી. સરકાર જો કોઇ વેરામાં થોડી અમથી છૂટ આપી દે તો અઠવાડિયા સુધી ટી.વી. અને છાપાંમાં તે સરકારની વાહ વાહ જોવા સાંભળવા મળે છે. એક કરોડ પરિવારઓએ સબસીડી છોડી દીધી અને આપણા દેશમાં સબસીડી એક પ્રકારનો હક્ક બની ગઇ છે તે જતી કરી, હું સૌથી પહેલાં તે એક કરોડ પરિવારોને શત શત નમન કરૂં છું. તેમને અભિનંદન આપું છું. કારણ કે, તેમણે રાજનેતાઓને નવી રીતે વિચારવાને મજબૂર કર્યા છે. આ એક ઘટનાએ દેશના અર્થશાસ્ત્રીઓને પણ નવી રીતે વિચારવા મજબૂર કરી દીધા છે. અને દુનિયાના અર્થવેતાઓને પણ આમ થશે તો તેમ થશે, આમ કરીશું તો તેમ પરિણામ આવશે, આ રીતે જે આર્થિક સમીકરણો બનાવે છે. તેમના માટે પણ તેમના વિચારોની હદ બહારની આ ઘટના છે. આના વિષે કયારેક ને કયારેક વિચારવું પડશે. એક કરોડ પરિવારો દ્વારા સબસીડી છોડવી એટલે, બદલામાં કરોડો ગરીબ પરિવારોને ગેસ સિલિન્ડર મળવો. એક કરોડ પરિવારો દ્વારા સબસીડી જતી કરવાથી જે રૂપિયાની બચત થશે તે બાહ્ય દ્રષ્ટિથી બહુ સામાન્ય બાબત છે. અસામાન્ય બાબત એ છે કે, જનતા પર ભરોસો રાખીને કામ કરીએ, તો કેટલી મોટી સિદ્ધિ મળે છે.!! હું ખાસ કરીને પૂરા રાજકારણી વર્ગને આજે આગ્રહપૂર્વક કહેવા માંગુ છું કે, આપણે દરેક જગ્યાએ જનતા પર ભરોસો મૂકનારી એક વાત જરૂર કરીએ. તમે કદિ વિચાર્યું પણ નહીં હોય કે, આવું પરિણામ આપણને મળશે. અને આપણે આ દિશામાં જવું જોઇએ. અને મને પણ સતત એવું લાગતું રહે છે. જેમ કે, મારા મનમાં થયું કે આ વર્ગ 3 અને 4 ના ઇન્ટરવ્યૂ શા માટે લેવાના ભાઇ ? જે પોતાની પરીક્ષા આપીને માર્કસ મોકલી રહ્યો છે, તેના પર ભરોસો મૂકો. કોઇ વાર તો મને એવું પણ લાગે છે કે, આપણે કયારેક જાહેર કરીએ કે, આજે રેલવેનો પેલો જે રૂટ છે તેમાં કોઇ ટિકિટ ચેકર નહીં રહે. જૂઓ તો ખરા, દેશની જનતા પર આપણે ભરોસો મૂકીએ, ઘણા બધા પ્રયોગો કરી શકીએ છીએ. દેશની જનતા પર આપણે એકવાર ભરોસો મૂકીએ તો અપ્રતિમ પરિણામ મળી શકે છે. ખેર, આ તો મારા મનના વિચારો છે. તેનો કોઇ સરકારનો નિયમ તો ન જ બનાવી શકીએ. પરંતુ વાતાવરણ તો બનાવી શકીએ છીએ. અને આ વાતાવરણ કોઇ રાજનેતા નથી બનાવી રહ્યા. દેશના એક કરોડ પરિવારોએ બનાવી દીધું છે.\nરવિ નામના કોઇ સજ્જને મને પત્ર લખ્યો છે. – દરરોજ સારા સમાચાર – તેઓ લખે છે કે, કૃપા કરીની તમારા અધિકારીઓને કહો કે દરરોજ કોઇ એક સારી ઘટના વિષે પોસ્ટ કરે. દરેક અખબાર અને ન્યૂઝ ચેનલમાં દરેક બ્રેકીંગ ન્યૂઝ ખરાબ સમાચાર જ હોય છે. શું સવાસો કરોડની વસ્તીવાળા દેશમાં આપણી આસપાસ કશુંય સારૂં થતું જ નથી ? કૃપા કરી આ પરિસ્થિતિ બદલો. રવિજીએ ભારે ગુસ્સો વ્યકત કર્યો છે. જો કે હું માનું છું કે, કદાચ તેઓ મારા ઉપર ગુસ્સો નથી કરી રહ્યા, પરિસ્થિતિ પર ગુસ્સો કરી રહ્યા છે. તમને યાદ હશે, ભારતના ભૂતપૂર્વ રાષ્ટ્રપતિ ડૉ. એ.પી.જે.અબ્દુલ કલામ હંમેશાં એ વાત કહેતા હતા કે, છાપાના પહેલા પાના પર કેવળ હકારાત્મક સમાચારો જ છાપો. તેઓ સતત આ વાત કહેતા રહેતા હતા. થોડા દિવસ પહેલાં એક અખબારે મને પત્ર પણ લખ્યો હતો. તેમણે કહ્યું હતું કે, અમે નક્કી કહ્યું છે કે, સોમવારે અમે એક પણ નકારાત્મક સમાચાર નહીં આપીએ. હકારાત્મક સમાચાર જ આપીશું. હાલના દિવસોમાં મેં જોયું છે, કેટલીક ટી.વી. ચેનલ ખાસ સમય નક્કી કરીને હકારાત્મક સમાચાર આપી રહી છે. !! એટલે એ તો ખરૂં છે જ કે હાલમાં હકારાત્મક સમાચારોનું વાતાવરણ બન્યું છે. અને હરકોઇને લાગી રહ્યું છે કે, યોગ્ય સમાચાર, સારા સમાચાર લોકોને મળતા રહે, એક વાત તો ખરી છે જ કે, મોટામાં મોટી વ્યકિત પણ ઉત્તમમાં ઉત્તમ વાત, સારામાં સારા શબ્દોમાં, શ્રેષ્ઠમાં શ્રેષ્ઠ રીતે જણાવશે તેનો જેટલો પ્રભાવ હોય છે. તેનાથી વધારે પ્રભાવ કોઇ સારા સમાચારનો હોય છે. સારા સમાચાર સારૂં કરવાની પ્રેરણાનું સૌથી મોટું કારણ બને છે. આમ એ તો ખરૂં છે જ કે જેટલું આપણે સારાપણાને બળ આપીશું એટચલી આપોઆપ બુરાઇઓ માટે જગ્યા ઓછી રહેશે. જો દીવો પ્રગટાવીશું તો અંધારૂં દૂર થશે, થશે ને થશે જ. અને એટલા માટે આપને કદાચ જાણ હશે. સરકાર દ્વારા એક વેબસાઇટ ચલાવવામાં આવે છે. ટ્રાન્સફોર્મિંગ ઇન્ડિયા તેના પર સકારાત્મક સમાચાર હોય છે. અને માત્ર સરકારના જ નહીં, જનતાના પણ હોય છે, અને આ એક એવું પોર્ટલ છે કે, તમે પણ તમારા કોઇ સારા સમાચાર હોય તો તેમાં તેને મોકલી શકો છો. તમે પણ તેમાં યોગદાન આપી શકો છો. રવિજી આપે સારૂં સૂચન કર્યું છે. પરંતુ કૃપા કરીને મારા પર ગુસ્સો ના કરશો. આપણે સૌ મળીને સકારાત્મક કરવાનો પ્રયાસ કરીએ. હકારાત્મક બોલવાનો પ્રયાસ કરીએ. હકારાત્મક પહોંચાડવાનો પ્રયાસ કરીએ.\nઆપણા દેશની વિશેષતા છે – કુંભમેળો. કુંભમેલો પ્રવાસનના આકર્ષનું કેન્દ્ર પણ બની શકે છે. દુનિયાના બહુ ઓછા લોકોને જાણ હશે કે, આટલા બધા લાંબા સમય સુધી નદીના તટ પર કરોડો કરોડો લોકો આવે. શાંતચિત્તે, શાંતિપૂર્ણ વાતાવરણમાં અવસર સંપન્ન થાય. આ ઘટનાઓ પોતે જ સંયોજનની દ્રષ્ટિએ, ઇવેન્ટ મેનેજમેન્ટની દ્રષ્ટિએ, લોકભાગીદારીની દ્રષ્ટિએ બહુ મોટા ધોરણો સિદ્ધ કરનારી હોય છે. છેલ્લા બે દિવસથી હું જોઇ રહ્યો છું કે, કેટલાય લોકો સિંહસ્થ કુંભની તસવીરો અપલોડ કરી રહ્યા છે. હું ઇચ્છીશ કે, ભારત સરકારનો પ્રવાસનવિભાગ, રાજય સરકારનો પ્રવાસન વિભાગ તેની સ્પર્ધા કરે. ફોટો સ્પર્ધા, અને લોકોને કહે કે સુંદરમાં સુંદર ફોટો પાડીને આપ અપલોડ કરો. કેવું એકદમથી વાતાવરણ સર્જાઇ જશે અને લોકોને પણ જાણ થશે કે કુંભમેળાના ખૂણેખૂણામાં કેટલી વિવિધતાઓથી ભરેલી બાબતો થઇ રહી છે. તો જરૂર આ કરી શકાય છે. જૂઓ, એ વાત ખરી છે, મને વચ્ચે મધ્યપ્રદેશના મુખ્યમંત્રી મળ્યા હતા. તેઓ કહેતા હતા કે, અમે સ્વચ્છતા પર વિશેષ જોર આપ્યું છે. અને કેવળ ત્યાં જ સ્વચ્છતા રહે એવું નહીં. ત્યાંથી લોકો સ્વચ્છતાનો સંદેશ પણ લઇને જાય. હું માનું છું , આ કુંભમેળો ભલે ધાર્મિક-આધ્યાત્મિક મેળો હોય, પરંતુ આપણે તેને એક સામાજિક તક પણ બનાવી શકીએ છીએ. સંસ્કારની તક પણ બનાવી શકીએ છીએ. ત્યાંથી સારા સંકલ્પ, સુટેવો, લઇને ગામેગામ પહોંચાડવાનું એક કારણ પણ બની શકે છે. આ કુંભમેળાથી પાણી પ્રત્યેનો પ્રેમ કેવી રીતે વધે, પાણી પ્રત્યેની આસ્થા કેવી રીતે વધે, જળસંચયનો સંદેશ આપવામાં કેવી રીતે આ કુંભમેળાનો પણ ઉપયોગ કરી શકીએ છીએ, તે આપણે કરવું જોઇએ.\nમારા વ્હાલા દેશવાસીઓ, પંચાયતીરાજના આ મહત્વપૂર્ણ દિવસ નિમિત્તે સાંજે તો હું આપને ફરીએકવાર મળવાનો જ છું. આપ સૌને કૂબ ખૂબ ધન્યવાદ. અને હર-હંમેશની જેમ આપના મનની વાતે મારા મનની વાત સાથે એક અતૂટ નાતો જોડ્યો છે. તેનો મને આનંદ છે. ફરી એક વાર ખૂબ ખૂબ ધન્યવાદ…\nAP/J.Khunt/GP\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue. On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees. But the matter would remain at a standstill. This has been everybody’s experience. No one ever thought beyond this.\nToday, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this. I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses. At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves. We should have implicit faith in the people. I had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500-2000 rupees per year, then why don’t you give up your subsidy on gas? This could be of use to poor households. I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. These one crore are not wealthy families. Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy. Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it. They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone. There were many options. But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers. Here, these one crore families have given up their subsidy. And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect. A thing like that they have chosen to give up.\nI would like to salute those one crore families. I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently. Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom. At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. Externally, it appears just an incident But, its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people, it leads to most handsome achievements.\nI would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined. We should move in this direction. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.\nSometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker. Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India. We can undertake several such experiments. Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results. Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts. We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere. This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.\nA person called Ravi has written to me – “Good News Everyday — he writes — please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day. Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every ‘breaking news’. Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people? Please change this situation.”\nRavi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions. You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, used to always say, “Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper”. He used to continuously repeat that.\nSome days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news. These days I have noticed that some T.V. channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news.\nSo it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news. And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news. It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.\nIt is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things. If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled. You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india. On this you get news of positive happenings, not just of the government but also of the people around. This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing that’s happened to you. You can contribute to the site.\nRaviji you have given a good suggestion, but please don’t get angry with me. We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.\nThere is one great speciality of our country — the Kumbh Mela. The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well. Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival. The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul. These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and people’s participation, set new and high standards. I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela. I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them. What an atmosphere that would create. People will also come to know of the myriad and different activities going on in every corner of the Kumbh Mela. This can surely be done.\nIt’s true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness. It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them. I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion. We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values. It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages. We should use each Kumbh Mela to make people aware of how we can increase our value for water, our faith in water; how we can spread the message of water conservation. We should do this.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today. My heartiest thanks to you all. As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.\nMany thanks!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all.

        "article": "\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासीयांनो, आपणा सर्वांना नमस्कार. सुट्ट्यांच्या काळात अनेक गोष्टी करायचे आपण ठरवतो. कार्यक्रम आखतो आणि ह्या सुट्ट्यांच्या काळात हंगाम असतो आंब्याचा म्हणून मनात येते की, आंब्याचा आस्वाद घ्यावा, असेही वाटते की दुपारी थोडी वामकुक्षी करता आली, तर बरं होईल. पण यावेळी कडक उन्हाळ्याने चहूकडे हा आनंद हिरावून घेतला आहे. देशभरात काळजीचे वातावरण असणे हे स्वाभाविक आहे. आणि त्यातही जेव्हा सतत दुष्काळ पडतो तेव्हा जलसाठे आटतात. कधी कधी अतिक्रमणामुळे, कधी मार्ग अरुंद झाल्यामुळे, अडथळे आल्यामुळे येणाऱ्या जलप्रवाहात बाधा आल्यामुळे जलाशयात क्षमतेपेक्षा कमी जलसंचय होतो. आणि वर्षांनुवर्ष हेच होत राहिल्याने जलधारण क्षमता कमी होते. दुष्काळावर मात करण्यासाठी, पाण्याच्या दुर्भिक्षावर मात करण्यासाठी राज्य सरकारे आपल्या पातळीवर प्रयत्न करतात. हे असले तरीही मी पाहिले आहे की नागरिकही यासाठी खूप चांगले प्रयत्न करतात. अनेक गावांमध्ये याबद्दल जागरुकता दिसते आणि पाण्याची खरी किंमत तेच जाणतात ज्यांनी जलदुर्भिक्षाच्या संकटाचा सामना केला आहे. आणि अशा ठिकाणी पाणी वाचवण्याबद्दल संवेदनशीलता असते, आणि त्याबद्दल काही करण्याची सक्रीयताही असते. काही दिवसांपूर्वीच मला सांगण्यात आले की महाराष्ट्रातल्या अहमदनगर जिल्ह्यातील हिवरे बाजार ग्रामपंचायत आणि तिथल्या गावकऱ्यांनी पाणी हा विषय अत्यंत संवेदनशील रितीने हाताळला आहे. पाणी साठवण्याची इच्छा असणारी अनेक गावं सापडतील, पण त्यांनी शेतकऱ्यांशी संवाद साधून पूर्ण पीक पद्धतीत बदल केला. अशी पिकं, ज्यांना अधिक पाणी लागते, उस असो, केळी असोत, अशा पिकांची लागवड न करण्याचा निर्णय त्यांनी घेतला. हे ऐकायला फार सोपे वाटते पण वाटते तितके हे सोपे नाही. सर्वांनी मिळून केवढा मोठा संकल्प केला असेल? एखाद्या कारखान्यात पाण्याचा वापर अधिक होत असेल, तर त्या कारखानदाराला तुझा उद्योग बंद कर कारण त्याला जास्त पाणी लागते, असे सांगितले तर त्याचा काय परिणाम होईल? हे आपण जाणता. पण हे माझे शेतकरी बांधव, पहा त्यांना वाटले, उसाला खूप पाणी लागते, मग ऊसाची लागवड करु नका, त्यांनी लागवड बंद केली आणि अशी फळे, भाज्या ज्यांना कमी पाणी लागते, त्यांची लागवड करण्याचा निर्णय त्यांनी घेतला. तुषार सिंचन, ठिबक सिंचन, जलसंधारण, जलपुनर्भरण याबाबतीत त्यांनी पुढाकार घेतला आणि त्यामुळे पाण्याच्या कमतरतेवर मात करण्यासाठी आज हे गाव स्वबळावर उभे राहिले आहे. बरोबर आहे, की मी तुम्हाला हिवरेबाजार या छोट्याशा गावाबद्दल सांगतो आहे, पण अशी अनेक गावं असतील, अशा सर्व गावकऱ्यांचे, त्यांच्या या उत्तम कामाबद्दल मी कौतुक करतो, त्यांना शुभेच्छा देतो.\nमला कुणीतरी सांगितले की, मध्य प्रदेशात देवास जिल्ह्यात गोरवा ग्रामपंचायत आहे. या ग्रामपंचायतीने प्रयत्नपूर्वक अभियान हाती घेतले ते शेततळ्यांच्या निर्मितीचे. सुमारे सत्तावीस शेततळी त्यांनी बांधली. परिणामी भूजल पातळी वाढली, पाण्याचा स्तर वर आला. जेव्हा पिकांना पाण्याची गरज भासली तेव्हा पाणी मिळाले आणि मोठमोठाले आकडे त्यांनी सांगितले. शेतीपासून त्यांना मिळणाऱ्या उत्पन्नात वीस टक्क्यांची वाढ झाली. पाण्याची बचत तर झालीच शिवाय पाण्याची पातळी वाढल्यामुळे पाण्याच्या गुणवत्तेत सुधारणा होते. आणि जगभर असे सांगितले जाते की पिण्याचे शुद्ध पाणी ढोबळ राष्ट्रीय उत्पन्नाच्या वाढीचे कारण ठरते. आरोग्यही त्यामुळे उत्तम राहाते. कधी कधी असे वाटते की, जेव्हा भारत सरकार लातूरला रेल्वेने पाणी पोचवते, तेव्हा जगासाठी ती एक बातमी होते. हे खरे आहे की, ज्या वेगाने रेल्वेने हे काम केले त्याबद्दल रेल्वेचे अभिनंदन करायला हवे, पण ते गावकरीही अभिनंदनासाठी पात्र आहेत, मी तर म्हणेन की त्यांचे विशेष अभिनंदन करायला हवे. पण असे अनेक उपक्रम नागरिकांकडून राबवले जातात, जे कधी समोर येत नाहीत. सरकारने एखादी चांगली मोहीम राबवली तर कधी कधी त्याला प्रसिद्धी मिळतेही पण आपल्या आजूबाजूला आपण पाहिले, तर लक्षात येईल की दुष्काळावर मात करण्यासाठी कशाप्रकारे नवनवीन उपाययोजनांमधून लोक या समस्येवर मार्ग काढण्यासाठी प्रयत्न करतात. कितीही संकटे येवोत पण एखादी चांगली गोष्ट कळली तर सारं संकट दूर झाल्याची भावना मनात निर्माण होते हा मनुष्य स्वभाव आहे. यंदाच्या पावसाळ्यात 106 ते 110 टक्के पाऊसमान असेल, ही शक्यता सर्वत्र कळली आणि ह्या बातमीने जणू एखादा शांती संदेशच सर्वांना मिळाला. पाऊस यायला अजून वेळ आहे पण चांगला पाऊस होणार ही बातमी चैतन्य घेऊन आली.\nपण माझ्या प्रिय देशवासीयांनो, यंदा पाऊस चांगला पडणार ही बातमी आपल्यासाठी जितकी आनंद देणारी आहे तितकीच आपल्या सगळ्यांसाठी एक संधी निर्माण करणारी आहे. एक आव्हान निर्माण करणारी आहे. गावागावात पाणी वाचवण्यासाठी एखादी मोहीम आत्तापासूनच आपण हातात घेऊ शकतो का? शेतकऱ्यांना मातीची गरज असते. शेतात पिकांसाठी ती उपयोगी ठरते. मग गावातल्या तळ्यातला गाळ काढून तो आम्ही शेतात टाकला तर? शेतीसाठी फायदा होईलच त्याचबरोबर तळ्यात पाणी साठण्याची क्षमता वाढेल. सिमेंटच्या रिकाम्या गोण्यांमधून, खताच्या रिकाम्या पोत्यांमधून दगड आणि माती भरुन आपण ते पाणी वाहून जाण्याच्या मार्गावर टाकले तर? पाणी अडवता येईल का? पाणी पाच दिवस साठेल, सात दिवस साठेल, ते पाणी जमिनीत मुरेल. जमिनीतली पाण्याची पातळी वाढेल. आमच्या विहींरींमध्ये पाणी येईल. जेवढे पाणी अडवता येईल, तेवढे अडवायला हवे. पावसाचे पाणी, गावात पडणारे पाणी गावात राहील. साऱ्यांनी मिळून संकल्प केला, तर सामुहिक प्रयत्नांमधून हे शक्य आहे. आज आपल्यापुढे पाण्याचे संकट आहे. दुष्काळाची स्थिती आहे पण येणारा महिना-दीड महिन्याचा काळ आपल्या हातात आहे. आणि मी तर नेहमी सांगतो की, कधी आपण पोरबंदर, महात्मा गांधीजींच्या जन्म स्थानी गेलो, तर वेगवेगळी ठिकाणे आपण बघतो. पण तिथे बघण्यासारखी आणखी एक महत्त्वाची जागा आहे. पावसाचे पाणी साठवण्यासाठी घराखाली कशा टाक्या बांधल्या आहेत. या दोनशे वर्ष जुन्या आहेत आणि त्यात साठणारे पाणी किती शुद्ध राहते हे बघण्यासारखे आहे.\nश्रीमान कुमार कृष्णा यांनी MyGov वर एक मुद्दा मांडला आहे आणि एका अर्थाने कुतूहल प्रगट केले आहे. ते म्हणतात की, आमच्या हयातीत गंगास्वच्छता मोहिम पूर्ण होणे शक्य आहे का? त्यांना वाटणारी चिंता साहाजिक आहे कारण जवळजवळ गेल्या तीस वर्षांपासूनच हे काम सुरु आहे. अनेक सरकारे आली, अनेक योजना आखण्यात आल्या, यासाठी खूप पैसाही खर्च झाला. आणि म्हणून कुमार कृष्णा यांच्या प्रमाणेच देशातल्या कोट्यवधी नागरिकांच्या मनात हा प्रश्न निर्माण होणे साहाजिक आहे धर्मावर श्रद्धा असणाऱ्यांसाठी गंगा मोक्षदायिनी आहे. गंगेचे हे महात्म्य मला मान्य आहेच पण त्याही पेक्षा गंगा जीवनदायिनी आहे, असे मी मानतो. गंगा आम्हाला भाकरी देते. गंगा आम्हाला रोजगार देते, गंगेकडून आम्हाला जगण्यासाठी नवी शक्ती मिळते. गंगा जशी वाहते तशी देशाच्या आर्थिक घडामोडींना एक नवी गती देते. एका भगीरथाने आपल्याला गंगा आणून दिली. पण तिला वाचवण्यासाठी कोट्यवधी भगीरथांची आज गरज आहे. लोक सहभागाशिवाय ही मोहिम कधीही यशस्वी होणार नाही. आणि म्हणून गंगेच्या स्वच्छतेसाठी आपण सर्वांनी बदल घडवणारे चेंज एजंट व्हायला हवे. पुन्हा पुन्हा, वारंवार हे सांगावे लागेल. सरकारी पातळीवर याबाबतीत अनेक प्रयत्न सुरु आहेत. गंगेकाठी असणाऱ्या राज्यांकडून यासाठी सहकार्य मिळवण्याचे प्रयत्न होत आहेत. सामाजिक तसेच स्वयंसेवी संघटनांना त्यात सहभागी करण्याचे प्रयत्न होत आहेत. गंगेचा प्रवाह, गंगेचा पृष्ठभाग स्वच्‍छ ठेवण्यासाठी आणि गंगेच्या पाण्यात होणारे औद्योगिक प्रदूषण थांबवण्यासाठी अनेक पावले उचलली गेली आहेत. गंगेच्या पात्रात, नाल्यांमधून रोज घनकचरा मोठ्या प्रमाणात वाहात येतो. हा कचरा स्वच्छ करण्यासाठी वाराणसी, अलाहाबाद, कानपूर, पटणा अशा जागी पाण्यावर तरंगणारा कचरा स्वच्छ करण्याचे काम ट्रॅश स्कीमर मदतीने केले जाते. सर्व स्थानिक प्रशासन संस्थांना हे उपलब्ध करुन देण्यात आले आहे आणि त्यांनी त्याचा वापर करुन कचरा साफ करावा, असे आवर्जून सांगितले गेले आहे. आणि नुकतेच मला सांगण्यात आले की, जिथे चांगल्या पद्धतीने हे प्रयत्न होत आहेत, त्याठिकाणी रोज तीन टन ते अकरा टन कचरा काढला जातो. म्हणजेच हे खरे आहे की इतक्या मोठ्या प्रमाणावर, होणारी घाण वाढण्यापासून थांबली आहे. येत्या काळात आणखी काही ठिकाणी ट्रॅश स्कीमर बसवण्याची योजना आखण्यात आली आहे. गंगेच्या आणि यमुनेच्या काठावर राहणाऱ्या लोकांना लवकरच त्याचा अनुभव येईल.\nऔद्योगिक प्रदूषणाला आळा घालण्यासाठी, कागद-लगदा उद्योग, मद्यनिर्मिती करणारे कारखाने आणि साखर कारखाने यांच्याबरोबर एक कृती आराखडा तयार करण्यात आला आहे. त्याची अंमलबजावणी काही प्रमाणात सुरु झाली आहे. त्याचे चांगले परिणाम होतील, असे आज तरी मला वाटतेय.\nमला हे ऐकून आनंद झाला की, उत्तराखंड आणि उत्तर प्रदेशातील मद्यनिर्मिती कारखान्यांनी शून्य द्रव विसर्ग, (zero liquid discharge) याबाबतीत यश मिळवले आहे. काही अधिकाऱ्यांनी गेल्या काही दिवसात ही माहिती मला दिली. कागद कारखान्यांमधून पडणारा टाकाऊ द्रव्यांचा विसर्ग आता जवळजवळ बंद होण्याच्या मार्गावर आहे. आपण योग्य दिशेने पावले टाकत आहोत, याचेच हे लक्षण आहे आणि एक प्रकारे जागरुकताही वाढली आहे. आणि मी बघितले आहे की, केवळ गंगेच्या काठावर राहणारीच नव्हे, तर दूरवरच्या दक्षिण भागातली एखादी व्यक्ती मला भेटते तेव्हा ती अवश्य म्हणते साहेब, गंगा स्वच्छ होईल ना! सर्वसामान्य लोकांचा हाच विश्वास, गंगा स्वच्छतेच्या मोहिमेला यश मिळवून देईल. गंगा स्वच्छ करण्याच्या कामात नागरिक दान देत आहेत. एका उत्तम रितीने हे काम सुरु आहे.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो. आज 24 एप्रिल. हा दिवस भारतात पंचायत राज दिवस म्हणून साजरा केला जातो. याच तारखेला आमच्या देशात पंचायत राजव्यवस्थेला सुरुवात झाली होती. आणि हळूहळू पूर्ण देशभर पसरलेली पंचायत राज प्रणाली, आमच्या लोकशाही शासन यंत्रणेचा एक महत्त्वाचा घटक म्हणून आज यशस्वी रितीने काम करीत आहे.\n14 एप्रिल रोजी डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकरांची 125वी जयंती आपण साजरी केली आणि आज 24 एप्रिल रोजी पंचायत राज दिवस साजरा करत आहोत. हा एक सुंदर योग आहे. ज्या महापुरुषाने\nभारताला संविधान दिले, त्या महामानवाच्या जयंतीपासून आज 24 एप्रिल पर्यंत आमच्या संविधानातील महत्वाचा भाग असणाऱ्या गाव या घटकाला जोडण्याची प्रेरणा मिळण्यासाठी केंद्र शासनाने राज्य शासनाच्या सहकार्याने 14 एप्रिल ते 24 एप्रिल पर्यंत दहा दिवसांच्या काळात ग्रामोदय ते भारतउदय हे अभियान राबवले. 14 एप्रिल रोजी डॉ.आंबेडकर यांच्या जयंतीदिनी, त्यांचे जन्मस्थळ असणाऱ्या महू या ठिकाणी जाण्याची संधी मला मिळाली हे मी माझे सुदैव मानतो. त्या पवित्र भूमीला नमन करण्याची संधी मिळाली आणि आज 24 तारखेला मी झारखंड राज्यात, जिथे सर्वाधिक संख्येने आमचे आदिवासी बंधु भगिनी राहतात, त्या राज्यात मी पंचायत राज दिवस साजरा करणार आहे. आणि दुपारी तीन वाजता देशभरातील सर्व पंचायत संस्थांशी संवाद साधला. या अभियानानं जागरुकता निर्माण करण्याचे एक मोठे काम केले आहे. हिंदुस्थानातील कानाकोपऱ्यात गाव पातळीवर लोकशाही संस्था कशा सशक्त होतील? गाव स्वयंपूर्ण कसं होईल? गाव स्वत: आपल्या विकासाच्या योजना कशा बनवेल? मूलभूत सोयी –सुविधा महत्वाच्या असतील, सामाजिक सोयी सुविधा महत्त्वाच्या असतील, शाळेतून विद्यार्थ्यांची गळती होणार नाही. ‘मुलगी वाचवा-मुलगी शिकवा’ मोहीम यशस्वीरित्या राबवली जाईल. मुलीचा वाढदिवस साऱ्या गावाचा उत्सव व्हायला हवा. अशा अनेक योजना आहेत.काही गावांमध्ये अन्नदानाचा उपक्रम हाती घेतला गेला. हिंदुस्थानातल्या इतक्या गावांमधून इतके विविध कार्यक्रम दहा दिवस चालणारे, बहुधा असं फार कमी वेळा होतं. मी सर्व राज्य सरकारांचं, सरपंचांचं अभिनंदन करतो, त्यांनी फार मौलिक पध्दतीने नाविन्य पूर्ण मार्गाने गावाच्या हितासाठी, गावाच्या विकासासाठी, लोकशाहीच्या बळकटीकरणासाठी ही मोहिम मला सुसंधीत परिवर्तित केली. गावांमधून जी जागरुकता आली आहे, तीच भारत-उदय याची शाश्वती आहे. भारत-उदय चा आधार ग्राम उदय हाच आहे. म्हणूनच ग्राम उदय यावर भर दिला तर इच्छित परिणाम आपण मिळवल्याशिवाय राहणार नाही.\nमुंबईहून शर्मिला घारपुरे यांनी फोन केला आणि त्यांच्या मनातली चिंता व्यक्त केली.\n“माननीय पंतप्रधान नमस्कार. मी मुंबईहून शर्मिला घारपुरे बोलत आहे. शाळा आणि महाविद्यालयीन शिक्षणाबाबत माझा प्रश्न आहे. शिक्षण क्षेत्रात गेल्या अनेक वर्षांपासून सुधारणांची गरज आहे. योग्य शाळा किंवा कॉलेज उपलब्ध नसणे किंवा शिक्षणाचा दर्जा नसणे. मुलांनी शिक्षण पूर्ण केल्यानंतरही त्यांना अनेक मुलभूत गोष्टी माहित नसतात. यामुळे जगात आपली मुलं मागे राहतात. याबाबत आपले विचार काय आहेत? आणि या क्षेत्रात कोणत्याप्रकारे आपण सुधारणा आणू इच्छिता याबाबत कृपा करुन सांगा. धन्यवाद.”\nही अशी काळजी वाटणं साहजिक आहे. आज प्रत्येक कुटुंबात आई वडीलांचे सर्वात मोठं स्वप्न असते ते म्हणजे मुलांचं शिक्षण. घर, गाडी या गोष्टी त्यानंतर आणि भारतासारख्या देशात नागरिकांच्या मनात अशी भावना असणे ही फार मोठी शक्ती आहे. मुलांना शिकवायचे, सुशिक्षित करायचे, चांगले शिक्षण कसे मिळेल याची चिंता पालकांना वाटावी याचे प्रमाण वाढले पाहिजे आणि मी असे मानतो की, ज्या कुटुंबांमध्ये ही जागरुकतेची जाणीव असते, त्याचा परिणाम शाळेवर पडलेला दिसतो. शिक्षकांवर पडलेला दिसतो आणि त्या मुलांमध्येही ही जाणीव निर्माण होते की हे ध्येय गाठण्यासाठी मी शाळेत जातोय आणि यासाठी मी सर्व पालकांना, माता-पित्यांना आवर्जून सांगेन की आपल्या मुलाच्या शालेय घडामोडींकडे लक्ष द्या, वेळ काढून त्याबद्दल मुलाशी बोला आणि जर एखादी गोष्ट जाणवली तर स्वत: शाळेत जा आणि शिक्षकांशी बोला. ही तुमची दक्षता, आपल्या शालेय व्यवस्थेतील काही त्रुटी कमी करु शकेल आणि लोक सहभागामुळे हे होईलच.\nआपल्या देशात प्रत्येक सरकारने शिक्षण या मुद्यावर भर दिला आहे. प्रत्येक सरकारने आपापल्या पध्दतीने त्यासाठी प्रयत्नही केले आहेत. आणि हेही खरं आहे की बराच काळ आमचे लक्ष या गोष्टीवर राहिले की शिक्षण संस्था उभ्या रहाव्यात, शिक्षण व्यवस्थेचा विस्तार व्हावा, शाळा तयार व्हाव्यात, महाविद्यालयं तयार व्हावीत, शिक्षकांची भरती व्हावी, अधिकाधिक मुले शाळेत यावीत. चहूबाजूला शिक्षणाचा प्रसार करण्याला आम्ही प्राधान्य दिले आणि ते आवश्यकही होते. पण आता जेवढे महत्व विस्ताराचे आहे त्यापेक्षा अधिक ते आमच्या शिक्षण व्यवस्थेतील सुधारणांचे आहे. विस्ताराचे एक फार मोठे काम आपण केले आहे. आता आपल्याला गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षणावर लक्ष केंद्रीत करायचे आहे. साक्षरता मोहिमेकडून दर्जेदार शिक्षण हे आता आमचे प्राधान्य असायला हवे. आजवर मोजणी झाली आराखड्याची आता लक्ष द्यायचे आहे परिणामावर. शाळेत किती मुले आली हे आजवर प्राधान्यानं पाहिले गेले. आता साक्षरतेपेक्षा, शिक्षणाकडे अधिक लक्ष द्यावे लागेल. मुलांची पट नोंदणी करा, पट नोंदणी करा, ह्या मंत्राचा आजवर उच्चार केला गेला. आता जी मुले शाळेल आली आहेत, त्यांना चांगले शिक्षण, योग्य शिक्षण मिळेल यावर आम्हाला लक्ष केंद्रीत करावं लागेल. या सरकारच्या अर्थसंकल्पातही आपण पाहिले असेल, चांगले शिक्षण देण्यावर भर देण्याचा प्रयत्न केला गेला आहे. फार मोठा पल्ला गाठायचा आहे, हे खरे आहे पण, शर्मिलाजींनी सांगितलेली गोष्ट खरी आहे की आमच्यात आमूलाग्र बदल घडवण्याची गरज आहे.\nआपण पाहिले असेल की यावेळच्या अर्थसंकल्पात वेगळा मार्ग निवडण्याचे काम झाले आहे. दहा सरकारी विश्वविद्यालये आणि दहा खाजगी विश्वविद्यालये यांना सरकारी नियंत्रणातून मुक्त करुन आव्हानात्मक, स्पर्धात्मक स्तरावर येण्याबद्दल सांगण्यात आल्याचं या अर्थसंकल्पात आपल्याला दिसेल. सर्वोत्कृष्ट विश्वविद्यालये, सर्वोत्कृष्ट विद्यापीठे होण्यासाठी आपण काम करु इच्छिता? सांगा. त्यांना पूर्ण स्वातंत्र्य देण्याच्या उद्देशाने ही योजना आणली गेली आहे. भारतीय विद्यापीठे जागतिक पातळीवर स्पर्धा करणारी विद्यापीठे होऊ शकतात. व्हायलाच हवीत. त्याबरोबरच शिक्षणाला जितके महत्त्व आहे. तितकेच कौशल्याला सुद्धा आहे. त्यासाठी आता शिक्षणात तंत्रज्ञानाची भूमिका महत्त्वाची ठरेल. दूरशिक्षण तंत्रज्ञान प्रणाली आमच्या शिक्षण व्यवस्थेला सुलभ करेल आणि लवकरच नजिकच्या भविष्यकाळात त्याचे परिणाम आपल्याला दिसतील असा मला विश्वास आहे.\nगेल्या बऱ्याच दिवसांपासून एका मुद्याबद्दल नागरिक मला विचारत आहेत. वेब पोर्टल MyGovवर ते लिहितात, काही जण माझ्या नरेंद्र मोदी ॲपवर लिहितात, आणि यात बहुसंख्य युवावर्ग लिहीत असतो.\n“माननीय पंतप्रधान नमस्कार, मी बिजनोरहून मोना कर्णवाल बोलत आहे. आजच्या काळातल्या युवकांसाठी शिक्षणाबरोबरच क्रीडा क्षेत्राचंही मोठं महत्त्व आहे. त्यांच्यात संघभावना असायला हवी, चांगले नेतृत्वगुण असायला हवेत, ज्यामुळे त्यांचा सर्वांगिण विकासही होईल. मी हे स्वानुभवावरुन बोलत आहे. कारण मी स्वत: भारत स्काऊटस् आणि गाईडमधे होतो आणि त्याचा माझ्या जीवनावर खूपच चांगला परिणाम झाला. आपण जास्तीत जास्त युवकांना प्रोत्साहित करावे अशी माझी इच्छा आहे आणि सरकारनेही एनसीसी, एनएसएस आणि भारत स्काऊटस् अँड गाईडस्‌ला प्रोत्साहन द्यावे.”\nआपण मला इतक्या सूचना पाठवल्यात. एक दिवस माझ्या मनात आले की, आपल्याशी बोलण्याआधी यासर्व मंडळींशी बोलून घ्यावे. यासाठी तुमचाच दबाव होता, तुमच्याच सूचना होत्या त्याचा परिणाम असा झाला की नुकतीच एक बैठक मी बोलावली होती. त्या बैठकीत एनसीसी, एनएसएस यांचे प्रमुख, स्काऊट आणि गाईडचे प्रमुख, रेड क्रॉस आणि नेहरु युवा केंद्राचे प्रमुख यांना बोलावले होते. आणि जेव्हा मी त्यांना विचारले की याआधी आपली अशी बैठक कधी झाली होती? त्यावर त्यांचे उत्तर होते की, देशाला स्वातंत्र्य मिळाल्यापासून आजवर अशा प्रकारची ही पहिलीच बैठक आहे. म्हणूनच या साऱ्या कामांच्या संदर्भात ज्या युवा वर्गाने, युवा मित्रांनी माझ्याकडे आग्रह धरला त्या सर्वांचे मी आभार मानतो. त्यांच्या सूचनांचा परिणाम म्हणून ही बैठक मी बोलावली आणि या अधिकाऱ्यांना मी भेटलो हे फार चांगले झाले, असे मला वाटते. यात मोठ्या प्रमाणावर समन्वयाची गरज आहे हे मला जाणवले. आपाआपल्या पातळीवर खूप कामं होत आहेत, पण सामुहिक स्वरुपात, संघटित स्वरुपात आमच्या संघटनांनी काम केले, तर त्याचा किती मोठा परिणाम मिळून शकतो. आणि केवढा विस्तार आहे त्यांचा, किती कुटुंबांपर्यंत त्या गेल्या आहेत, पोहचल्या आहेत. यांचा आवाका, परीघ बघून मला फार समाधान वाटले. आणि त्यांच्यातही उत्साह दांडगा दिसला, काही तरी करण्याचा. आता हे खरे आहे की मी स्वत: एनसीसी म्हणजे राष्ट्रीय छात्र सेनेचा कॅडेट होतो. त्यामुळे मला हे ठाऊक आहे की, अशा संघटनांमुळे एक नवी दृष्टी मिळते, प्रेरणा मिळते. एक राष्ट्रीय दृष्टीकोन वाढीला लागतो. मला लहानपणी त्याचा लाभ मिळाला आणि हेही मी मानतो की अशा संघटनांमध्ये नवी चेतना भरली पाहिजे. नवी शक्ती भरली पाहिजे. या बैठकीत काही मुद्दे मी त्यांच्या समोर मांडले. मी त्यांना सुचवले की या हंगामात जलसंचय, पाणी साठवण्याचे काम आपल्या तरुणांनी, संघटनांनी का करु नये? कितीतरी प्रभाग कितीतरी जिल्हे आपण हागणदारी मुक्त करण्यात प्रयत्नपूर्वक यश मिळवले. लोकांना शौचासाठी उघड्यावर जाण्यापासून थांबवले. देश जोडण्यासाठी कोणते कार्यक्रम आखू शकतो? आमच्या सर्व संघटनांचे मिळून एक, समान युवा-गीत कोणते असेल? अनेक गोष्टींवर त्यांच्याशी बोलणे झाले.\nमी आज आपल्याला आवर्जून सांगेन, आपणही मला सांगा, अगदी नेमके उपाय, नेमक्या सूचना पाठवा. आपल्याकडे अनेक युवा संघटना कार्यरत आहेत, त्यांच्या कार्यपद्धतीत, कार्यक्रमांमध्ये काय नाविन्य आणता येईल? माझ्या नरेंद्र मोदी ॲपवर आपण हे लिहीलंत, तर ते योग्य जागी मी पोचवेन आणि मला वाटते की या बैठकीनंतर या सर्व गोष्टींना एक गती मिळेल. हे मला वाटते आणि या सर्वांबरोबर स्वत:ला समाविष्ट करावे, असे आपल्याही मनात येईल, असे होईलच.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, आपणा सर्वांना विचार करायला भाग पाडेल अशी एक गोष्ट मला सांगायची आहे. आम्हा सर्वांना जागृत करणारी ही गोष्ट आहे, असे मला वाटते. आपण पाहिले असेल की आपल्या देशाची राजकीय अवस्था अशी आहे की मागच्या अनेक निवडणुकांच्या वेळी कोणता पक्ष किती गॅस सिलेंडर देईल? यावर चर्चा होत असे. 12 सिलेंडर की 9? निवडणुकीच्या काळात हा एक महत्त्वाचा, मोठा विषय ठरत असे. आणि प्रत्येक राजकीय पक्षाला असे वाटायचे की मध्यमवर्गीय लोकांपर्यंत निवडणुकीच्या वाटेने पोचायचे असेल, तर गॅस सिलेंडर हा मोठा महत्त्वाचा विषय आहे. दुसऱ्या बाजूला अर्थतज्ञांचा आग्रह असायचा की अनुदानात कपात करा. त्यासाठी अनेक समित्या स्थापन झाल्या. गॅस सिलेंडरवरचे अनुदान कमी करण्यासाठी या समित्यांसमोर अनेक प्रस्ताव येत असत. सूचना येत असत. या समित्यांवर कोट्यवधी रुपये खर्च होत असत, मात्र मूळ मुद्दा तसाच राहात असे. हा सार्वत्रिक अनुभव आहे. पण या चौकटीच्या बाहेर जाऊन कधी विचार केला गेला नाही. आज, माझ्या देशवासियांनो, आपल्यासमोर माझा हिशोब मांडताना मला आनंद होतो आहे. मी वेगळाच मार्ग निवडला, आणि तो मार्ग होता जनता जनार्दनावर विश्वास टाकण्याचा. कधी कधी आम्ही राजकीय नेत्यांनी स्वत:वर विश्वास ठेवण्यापेक्षा आपल्या लोकांवर अधिक विश्वास ठेवायला हवा. मी जनता जनार्दनावर विश्वास ठेवून एकदा असेच म्हणालो होतो की, वर्षभरात 1500, 2000 रुपयांचा वाढीव खर्च आपण सहन करु शकतो, तर मग गॅस सिलेंडरवर मिळणारे अनुदान आपण का सोडून देत नाही? ते अनुदान एखाद्या गरीबाला उपयोगी पडेल. हे मी असेच बोललो होतो पण आज मी अत्यंत अभिमानपूर्वक आपल्याला सांगू शकतो. माझ्या देशवासियांबद्दल मला अभिमान वाटतो.\nएक कोटी कुटुंबांनी स्वेच्छेने, गॅस अनुदान घ्यायचे नाकारले आहे. आणि हे अनुदान सोडणारे कुणी श्रीमंत, निवृत्त लिपीक, कुणी शेतकरी, कुणी किरकोळ दुकानदार, असे मध्यमवर्गातले, निम्न-मध्यम वर्गातले लोक, ज्यांनी गॅस सिलेंडरवर मिळणारे अनुदान सोडून दिले आहे. आणखी एक वैशिष्ट्य बघा, हे अनुदान सोडण्यासाठी मोबाईल फोनवरच्या ॲपचा वापर करणे शक्य होते, दूरध्वनीवरुन मिस्ड कॉल देऊन करणे शक्य होते, अनेक मार्ग होते. पण याचा धांडोळा घेतला गेला तेव्हा असे लक्षात आले की, या एक कोटी लोकांपैकी 80 टक्के नागरिक असे होते की जे त्यांच्या वितरकाकडे स्वत: गेले, रांगेत उभे राहीले आणि आपले गॅस सिलेंडरवरचे अनुदान त्यांनी लेखी स्वरुपात परत केले.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, ही काही लहान गोष्ट नाही. सरकारने एखाद्या करात थोडी सवलत दिली, तर आठवडाभर दूरचित्रवाणी आणि वर्तमानपत्रातून त्या सरकारची प्रशंसा ऐकू येते. एक कोटी कुटुंबांनी अनुदान सोडून दिले. आमच्या देशात अनुदान म्हणजे अधिकार असे समीकरण असताना अनुदान नाकारले. त्या एक कोटी कुटुंबांना मी सर्वप्रथम वंदन करतो, त्यांचे आभार मानतो, कारण एक नवा, एक वेगळा विचार करायला त्यांनी राजकीय नेत्यांना भाग पाडलं आहे. या एका घटनेने देशातील अर्थतज्ञांना नव्या पद्धतीने विचार करायला भाग पाडले आहे. आणि जगभरचे अर्थतज्ञ जे असे झाले, तर असे होईल, हे केले तर ते मिळेल, अशी आर्थिक समीकरणे मांडत असतात त्यांच्यासाठी सुद्धा त्यांच्या विचार करण्याच्या कक्षेच्या बाहेरची ही घटना म्हणावी लागेल. यावर कधी ना कधी विचार करावाच लागेल. एक कोटी कुटुंबांनी गॅस अनुदान सोडणे आणि त्याबदल्यात कोट्यवधी गरीब कुटुंबांना गॅस सिलेंडर मिळणे. एक कोटी कुटुंबांनी अनुदान सोडल्यामुळे काही रुपये वाचणे हे वरवर पाहता तसे महत्त्वाचे वाटत नाही. महत्त्वाचे हे आहे की जनतेवर विश्वास ठेवला, तर हाती केवढे मोठे यश लागू शकते. मी विशेषत: सर्व राजकीय वर्गाला आज आवर्जून सांगेन की प्रत्येक ठिकाणी, लोकांवर विश्वास ठेवण्याची किमान एक तरी गोष्ट आपण करु या. आपण कधी विचारही केला नसेल, असा परिणाम आम्हाला मिळेल. या दिशेला आपण जायला हवे. आणि मला तर नेहमी वाटते की जसे माझ्या मनात आले की तृतीय आणि चतुर्थ श्रेणीच्या नोकरीसाठी मुलाखत का घ्यावी? ज्यांनी परीक्षा देऊन, गुण मिळवले आहेत, ते पाठवले आहेत त्यांच्यावर विश्वास ठेवा. कधी कधी मला असेही वाटते की असे आपण घोषित करु या, की रेल्वेच्या ह्या एका मार्गावर कुणीही तिकीट तपासनीस नसेल. बघूया तर, ठेवूया विश्वास देशातील जनतेवर असे अनेक प्रयोग करता येतील. एकदा या देशातल्या जनतेवर विश्वास ठेवा, बघा अप्रतिम परिणाम मिळतील. असो. हे माझ्या मनात येते, हे काही सरकारी नियम नाही होऊ शकत. पण विश्वासाचं वातावरण तर तयार करु शकतो. आणि हे वातावरण तयार करणारे कुणी राजकीय नेते नाहीत, देशातील एक करोड कुटुंबांनी ते तयार केले आहे.\nरवी नामक सद्‌गृहस्थांनी मला पत्र लिहिले आहे “Good News Every day”, रोज शुभवर्तमान. ते लिहीतात की कृपया आपल्या अधिकाऱ्यांना सांगा की रोज एखाद्या चांगल्या घटनेबद्दल त्यांनी माहिती द्यावी. प्रत्येक वर्तमानपत्रात आणि वृत्त वाहिनीवर प्रत्येक ब्रेकिंग न्यूज, त्रासदायक असते. शंभर-सव्वाशे कोटी लोकसंख्या असणाऱ्या या देशात, आमच्या आजूबाजूला काही चांगले घडतच नाही का? कृपया ही परिस्थिती बदला. रविजींनी त्यांचा तीव्र संताप व्यक्त केला आहे. पण मला वाटते की हा राग माझ्यावरचा नसून भोवतालच्या परिस्थितीवरचा आहे. आपल्याला आठवत असेल, आपले माजी राष्ट्रपती डॉ. A.P.J अब्दुल कलाम नेहमी सांगत असत, की वर्तमानपत्राच्या पहिल्या पानावर केवळ सकारात्मक बातम्या छापा. ते सतत ही गोष्ट सांगत राहीले. काही दिवसांपूर्वी एका वर्तमान पत्रानं मला पत्र लिहून कळवलं होतं की त्यांनी असं ठरवलं आहे की प्रत्येक सोमवारी एकही नकारात्मक बातमी ते छापणार नाहीत, सकारात्मक बातम्याच देणार.\nहल्ली मी बघितले आहे की काही दूरचित्रवाणी वाहिन्या सकारात्मक बातम्या विशिष्ट वेळ ठरवून देतात. आजच्या काळात सकारात्मक बातम्यांचं वातावरण तयार होत आहे. अचूक बातमी, चांगली बातमी लोकांना मिळावी असे प्रत्येकाला वाटतंय. हे खरं आहे की मोठ्यात मोठी व्यक्ती, चांगल्यातली चांगली गोष्ट, उत्तमोत्तम शब्दांचा वापर करुन, चांगल्यातल्या चांगल्या पध्दतीने सांगितली जाईल, तेव्हा त्याचा जेवढा परिणाम होतो त्याहीपेक्षा अधिक परिणाम सकारात्मक बातमीचा चांगल्या बातमीचा होतो. हे खरं आहे की भलेपणावर अधिक भर दिला तर आपल्यात वाईट गोष्टींसाठी फार जागा उरणार नाही. दीप पेटवला तर अंध:कार दूर होईल, होईलच होईल. आणि म्हणूनच आपल्याला हे कदाचित ठावूक असेल की ट्रान्सफॉर्मिंग इंडिया या नावाची वेबसाईट सरकारने सुरु केली आहे. एक संकेतस्थळ सुरु केले आहे, या संकेतस्थळावर सकारात्मक बातम्या असतात. केवळ सरकारच्याच नाही, नागरिकांच्या सुध्दा असतात. आणि हे असं पोर्टल आहे ज्यावर आपण, आपल्याकडची, एखादी चांगली बातमी पाठवू शकता. योगदान देवू शकता. रवीजी तुम्ही चांगली सूचना मांडली आहे, पण कृपया माझ्यावर रागावू नका. आपण सारे मिळून सकारात्मक काम करण्याचा प्रयत्न करुया. सकारात्मक बोलण्याचा प्रयत्न करुया. सकारात्मक पोचवण्याचा प्रयत्न करुया.\nकुंभमेळा हे आपल्या देशाचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे. कुंभमेळा हे पर्यटनाच्या दृष्टीने आकर्षण केंद्र बनू शकते. जगातल्या फार कमी जणांना हे माहीत असतं की इतका दीर्घकाळ, नदी काठावर कोट्यवधी लोक येतात. शांत चित्त आणि शांततापूर्ण वातावरणात सोहळा साजरा होतो. अशा घटना आयोजनाच्या दृष्टीने, कार्यक्रम व्यवस्थापनाच्या दृष्टीने, लोक सहभागाच्या दृष्टीने, नवे मापदंड स्थापन करणाऱ्या ठरतात. गेल्या दोन दिवसापासून मी पाहतो आहे, अनेक जण कुंभमेळ्याची छायाचित्रे अपलोड करीत आहेत. मला वाटते की भारत सरकारच्या पर्यटन विभागाने राज्य शासनाच्या पर्यटन विभागाने, अशा छायाचित्रांची स्पर्धा घ्यावी आणि लोकांना आवाहन करावे की उत्तमोत्तम छायाचित्र काढून Upload करा. पहा, एकदम वातावरण निर्मिती होईल आणि लोकांनाही कळेल की कुंभमेळ्यात किती विविधतेने भरलेल्या गोष्टी सुरु आहेत. हे अवश्य करता येईल.\nमध्यंतरी मध्य प्रदेशचे मुख्यमंत्री मला भेटले होते. स्वच्छतेवर विशेष भर दिल्याचे त्यांनी सांगितले. केवळ तिथेच स्वच्छता असावी असे नाही तर तिथून परतणारे लोक हा स्वच्छतेचा संदेश घेऊन जातील. मला असं वाटते की कुंभमेळा हा धार्मिक, अध्यात्मिक मेळावा आहे पण आपण त्याचे रुपांतर एका सामाजिक सोहळ्यात करु शकतो. संस्कार करण्याची सुसंधी असणारा सोहळा करु शकतो. तिथून परतताना चांगले संकल्प, चांगल्या सवयी घेऊन त्या गावागावात पोचवण्याचे एक निमित्त ठरू शकतो कुंभमेळा. पाण्याविषयी वाटणारा स्नेह, कसा वाढेल? पाण्याविषयी वाटणारी कळकळ कशी वाढेल? पाणी साठवण्याचा संदेश देता येईल यासाठी या कुंभमेळ्याचा उपयोग व्हायला हवा, आम्ही तो तसा करायला हवा.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासीयांनो, पंचायत राज दिनाच्या या महत्वपूर्ण दिवशी आज संध्याकाळी मी पुन्हा भेटेनच. आपणा सर्वांना अनेक अनेक धन्यवाद. नेहमीप्रमाणेच आपल्या मनातल्या गोष्टीने माझ्या मनातल्या गोष्टीशी एक अतूट नाते जोडले आहे, याचा मला आनंद वाटतो, पुन्हा एकदा अनेक अनेक धन्यवाद.\nS.

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue. On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees. But the matter would remain at a standstill. This has been everybody’s experience. No one ever thought beyond this.\nToday, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this. I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses. At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves. We should have implicit faith in the people. I had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500-2000 rupees per year, then why don’t you give up your subsidy on gas? This could be of use to poor households. I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. These one crore are not wealthy families. Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy. Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it. They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone. There were many options. But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers. Here, these one crore families have given up their subsidy. And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect. A thing like that they have chosen to give up.\nI would like to salute those one crore families. I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently. Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom. At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. Externally, it appears just an incident But, its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people, it leads to most handsome achievements.\nI would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined. We should move in this direction. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.\nSometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker. Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India. We can undertake several such experiments. Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results. Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts. We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere. This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.\nA person called Ravi has written to me – “Good News Everyday — he writes — please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day. Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every ‘breaking news’. Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people? Please change this situation.”\nRavi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions. You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, used to always say, “Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper”. He used to continuously repeat that.\nSome days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news. These days I have noticed that some T.V. channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news.\nSo it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news. And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news. It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.\nIt is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things. If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled. You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india. On this you get news of positive happenings, not just of the government but also of the people around. This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing that’s happened to you. You can contribute to the site.\nRaviji you have given a good suggestion, but please don’t get angry with me. We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.\nThere is one great speciality of our country — the Kumbh Mela. The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well. Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival. The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul. These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and people’s participation, set new and high standards. I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela. I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them. What an atmosphere that would create. People will also come to know of the myriad and different activities going on in every corner of the Kumbh Mela. This can surely be done.\nIt’s true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness. It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them. I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion. We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values. It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages. We should use each Kumbh Mela to make people aware of how we can increase our value for water, our faith in water; how we can spread the message of water conservation. We should do this.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today. My heartiest thanks to you all. As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.\nMany thanks!\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue. On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees. But the matter would remain at a standstill. This has been everybody’s experience. No one ever thought beyond this.\nToday, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this. I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses. At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves. We should have implicit faith in the people. I had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500-2000 rupees per year, then why don’t you give up your subsidy on gas? This could be of use to poor households. I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. These one crore are not wealthy families. Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy. Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it. They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone. There were many options. But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers. Here, these one crore families have given up their subsidy. And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect. A thing like that they have chosen to give up.\nI would like to salute those one crore families. I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently. Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom. At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. Externally, it appears just an incident But, its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people, it leads to most handsome achievements.\nI would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined. We should move in this direction. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.\nSometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker. Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India. We can undertake several such experiments. Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results. Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts. We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere. This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.\nA person called Ravi has written to me – “Good News Everyday — he writes — please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day.

ஏதாவது தொழிற்சாலை அதிக நீரைப் பயன்படுத்துகிறது என்றால், அந்த தொழிற்சாலையை மூடுங்கள் என்று கூறினால், என்ன விளைவு ஏற்படும் என்று நீங்களே அறிவீர்கள். ஆனால் எனது விவசாய சகோதரர்களைப் பாருங்கள், கரும்புக்கு அதிக நீர் தேவை என்பதால் கரும்பு நடவு செய்யாதீர்கள் என்றவுடன் உடனே விட்டு விட்டார்கள். முழுக்க முழுக்க அவர்கள் பழங்களையும் காய்கறிகளையும் பயிரிட்டார்கள், அதாவது எதற்கு மிகக் குறைந்த அளவு நீர் தேவைப்படுகிறதோ அதை மட்டுமே பயிர் செய்தார்கள்.\nஅவர்கள் தெளிப்பான், சொட்டு நீர் பாசனம், மழைநீர் சேமிப்பு, water recharging அதாவது மழை நீர் மறுசெறிவு என பல முனைப்புக்கள் மூலமாக இன்று தண்ணீர் பிரச்சனையை சமாளிக்க தங்கள் சொந்த முயற்சியில் வெற்றி கண்டுள்ளார்கள். சரி, நான் சின்னஞ்சிறிய ஒரு கிராமமான ஹிவ்ரே பாஜார் பற்றி பேசியிருக்கிறேன், ஆனால் இப்படி பல கிராமங்கள் இருக்கலாம். அப்படிப்பட்ட கிராமவாசிகளுக்கும், நீங்கள் சாதித்திருக்கும் சிறப்பான செயல்களுக்காக நான் பலப்பல வாழ்த்துக்களைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன்.\nயாரோ ஒருவர் என்னிடம் மத்திய பிரதேச மாநிலத்தின் தேவாஸ் மாவட்டத்தில் இருக்கும் கோர்வா GORVA கிராம பஞ்சாயத்து பற்றிக் கூறினார். பஞ்சயத்தார் முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொண்டு, farm ponds பண்ணைக் குளங்கள் அமைக்க ஒரு இயக்கத்தை நடத்தினார்கள். சுமார் 27 பண்ணைக் குளங்கள் அமைக்கப்பட்டு, அதனால் நிலத்தடி நீர் அளவு அதிகரித்தது, நீர் மட்டம் உயர்ந்தது. எப்போதெல்லாம் பயிர்களுக்கு நீர்த் தேவை இருந்ததோ, அப்போதெல்லாம் நீர் கிடைத்தது, அவர்களின் விவசாய உற்பத்தியில் சுமார் 20 சதவீத அதிகரிப்பு காணப்பட்டதாகவும் அவர்கள் கணக்குத் தெரிவிக்கிறார்கள்.\nநீர் சேமிக்கப்பட்டதோடு நிலத்தடி நீர் மட்டம் அதிகரித்தது, நீரின் தரம் மேம்பாடு கண்டது. உள்நாட்டு மொத்த உற்பத்தி என்பது வளர்ச்சி காரணமாகத்தான் ஏற்படுகிறது என்று உலகில் கூறப்படுகிறது இல்லையா, உடல் நலம் பற்றி கேட்கவே வேண்டாம். இந்திய அரசு ரயில்கள் மூலமாக தண்ணீரை லாடூருக்கு கொண்டு சேர்க்கும் போது அது உலகிற்கு ஒரு செய்தியாக ஆவதைப் பற்றி எண்ணமிடுகிறேன்.\nமிக விரைவான முறையில் நீரைக் கொண்டு சேர்த்ததில் ரயில்வே துறைக்கு பாராட்டுத் தெரிவிக்க வேண்டும் என்பது என்னவோ உண்மை தான், அதே சமயம் அந்த கிராமவாசிகளும் பாராட்டுக்குரியவர்களே. என்னைப் பொறுத்த வரையில் அவர்கள் இன்னும் கூட அதிகம் பாராட்டப் பட வேண்டியவர்கள். ஆனால் இப்படி பல திட்டங்கள் குடிமக்கள் வாயிலாகவே செயல்படுகின்றன, எப்போதும் அவை வெளிச்சத்துக்கு வருவதில்லை. அரசு செயல்படுத்தும் நல்ல விஷயங்களாவது எப்போதாவது தெரிய வருகிறது, ஆனால் நாம் நம்மைச் சுற்றிப் பார்த்தோமேயானால், வறட்சியை எதிர்கொள்ள எந்தெந்த மாதிரியாக, புதுப்புது வழிமுறைகளை மேற்கொண்டு பிரச்சனைக்குத் தீர்வு காணும் முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொள்ளப்படுகின்றன என்பது நமக்குப் புலனாகும்.\nஎந்த ஒரு சங்கடத்தை அனுபவித்துக் கொண்டிருந்தாலும், ஏதோ ஒரு இடத்திலிருந்து ஒரு நல்ல செய்தி வந்து விட்டால், மொத்த சங்கடமும் தொலைந்து போனதாக உணர்வது தான் மனித இயல்பு. இந்த முறை மழையளவு 106 சதவீதம் முதல் 110 சதவீதம் வரை இருக்கும் வாய்ப்பு உள்ளது என்ற செய்தியை கேள்விப்பட்டதிலிருந்து, ஏதோ பெரியதொரு மகிழ்வான செய்தி வந்தது போல உணர்கிறேன். மழை பெய்ய இன்னும் காலம் இருந்தாலும், நல்ல மழை பொழிவு பற்றிய செய்தி கூட புத்துணர்வை கொண்டு சேர்த்திருக்கிறது.\nஆனால் எனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, நல்ல மழை இருக்கும் என்ற தகவல் எத்தனை ஆனந்தத்தை அளிக்கிறதோ, அதே அளவுக்கு அது வாய்ப்பையும் அமைத்துக் கொடுக்கிறது, சவாலையும் முன்வைக்கிறது. கிராமம் தோறும் நீரை சேமிக்கும் இயக்கத்தை நம்மால் இப்போதே கூட தொடக்க முடியாதா? விவசாயிகளுக்கு மண் தேவைப்படுகிறது, விளை நிலங்களில் இது அவர்களுக்கு உதவியாக இருக்கிறது.\nகிராமங்களின் ஏரிகளில் இருக்கும் மண்ணை தூர் வாரி வயல்வெளிகளில் ஏன் நாம் போடக் கூடாது; அப்போது வயல்களின் மண்வளம் பெருகும் அதே வேளை, நீர் நிலைகளின் நீர் சேமிப்பு அளவும் அதிகரிக்குமே! காலியான சிமெண்ட் சாக்குகள், காலி உரமூட்டைப் பைகள் போன்றவற்றில் கல்லையும் மண்ணையும் நிரப்பி நீர் வெளியேறும் வழிகளில் போட்டு அடைத்து விட்டால் என்ன? நீர் 5 நாட்கள், 7 நாட்கள் என்று தேங்கியிருந்தால், நீர் நிலத்தடி நீராக மாறி விடுமே! தானாகவே நிலத்தடி நீர் மட்டம் உயருமே! நமது குளங்களில் நீர் வரத்து ஏற்படும். முடிந்த மட்டில் நீர் வெளியேறுவதைத் தடுக்க வேண்டும். மழை நீர், கிராமத்தின் நீராக இருக்கும், இந்தத் தீர்மானத்தை நாம் மேற்கொண்டு ஏதாவது ஒன்றை செய்ய வேண்டும், இது ஒட்டுமொத்த சமுதாயமும் இணைந்து ஈடுபடும் போது தான் இது சாத்தியமாகும். இன்று நீர் தட்டுப்பாட்டு பிரச்சனை இருக்கலாம், வறட்சி நிலை இருக்கலாம், ஆனால் நம்மிடம் ஒன்று ஒன்றரை மாத கால அவகாசம் இருக்கிறது; நான் ஒரு விஷயத்தை எப்போதுமே கூறுவதுண்டு, நாம் எப்போதாவது அண்ணல் காந்தியடிகள் பிறந்த இடமான போர்பந்தருக்குச் செல்லும் போது அங்கே பல்வேறு இடங்களை நாம் பார்க்கலாம், அவற்றில் ஒரு இடம் பார்க்க வேண்டிய ஒன்றாக இருக்கிறது; அதாவது நீரை சேமித்து வைக்க எப்படி வீட்டுக்கு அடியில் குளங்களை 200 ஆண்டுகளுக்கும் முன்பாக அமைத்திருந்தார்கள், அந்த நீர் எத்தனை சுத்தமாக இருக்கிறது என்பதும் தெரிந்து கொள்ள வேண்டிய ஒன்று.\nதிரு. குமார் க்ருஷ்ணா என்ற ஒருவர் mygov இணையதளத்தில் எழுதி இருக்கிறார், ஒரு வகையில் ஏக்கத்தையும் வெளிப்படுத்தி இருக்கிறார். நம் வாழ்நாளில் கங்கையை தூய்மைப்படுத்தும் இயக்கம் முழுமை அடையுமா என்று கேட்டிருக்கிறார். அவரது கவலை மிகவும் இயல்பான ஒன்று தான், ஏனென்றால் சுமார் 30 ஆண்டுக்காலமாக இந்தப் பணி நடைபெற்று வந்திருக்கிறது. பல அரசுகள் வந்தன, பல திட்டங்கள் உருவாயின, ஏகப்பட்ட பணம் செலவானது, இதன் காரணமாக, சகோதரர் குமார் க்ருஷ்ணா மாதிரியாக நாட்டில் பல கோடி மக்களின் மனதில் இது போன்றதொரு கேள்வி எழுவது இயல்பான ஒன்று தான். சமய நம்பிக்கை உள்ளவர்கள், வீடுபேற்றை அளிப்பவளாக கங்கையை கருதுகிறார்கள்.\nஅந்த மஹாத்மியத்தை நானும் கூட ஏற்கிறேன், ஆனால் அதையும் தாண்டி கங்கையை உயிர் அளிப்பவளாக நான் காண்கிறேன். கங்கைதான் நமக்கு உணவளிக்கிறாள்; கங்கையே நமக்கு வேலை தருகிறாள்; கங்கைதான் நமக்கெல்லாம் வாழத் தேவையான சக்தியை அளிக்கிறாள். கங்கையின் பிரவாஹம் எப்படி அமைகிறதோ, அதை ஒட்டித்தான் நாட்டின் பொருளாதார செயல்பாடுகளிலும் ஒரு வேகம் கிடைக்கிறது. ஒரு பகீரதன் நமக்கு கங்கையை கொண்டு வந்தார், ஆனால் அதைக் காக்க பல கோடிக்கணக்கான பகீரதர்கள் தேவைப் படுகிறார்கள். மக்கள் பங்களிப்பு இல்லாமல் பணியில் வெற்றி காண முடியாது, ஆகையால் நாமனைவரும் தூய்மைக்கான, சுத்தத்துக்கான ஒரு change agentகளாக, மாற்ற செயலிகளாக மாற வேண்டும். திரும்பத் திரும்ப இந்த விஷயத்தைச் சொல்ல வேண்டும், நினைவுறுத்த வேண்டும்.\nஅரசு தரப்பில் பல முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொள்ளப்பட்டு வருகின்றன. கங்கைக் கரைகளில் எந்தெந்த மாநிலங்கள் எல்லாம் இருக்கின்றனவோ, அந்த மாநிலங்களின் முழுமையான ஒத்துழைப்பு கோரும் முயற்சி நடந்து வருகிறது. சமூகம் மற்றும் தூய்மை சார்ந்த அமைப்புக்களையும் ஒன்றிணைக்கும் முயற்சி நடைபெற்று வருகிறது. Surface cleaning, பரப்பை சுத்தப்படுத்தல் மற்றும் தொழில்துறை மாசினை தடுக்கும் விதமாக பல நடவடிக்கைகள் மேற்கொள்ளப்பட்டிருக்கின்றன. ஒவ்வொரு நாளும் கால்வாய்கள் வழியாக திடக் கழிவுகள் பெரிய அளவில் வந்து கலக்கின்றன. இது போன்ற கழிவுகளை சுத்தம் செய்ய வாராணசி, இலாஹாபாத், கான்பூர், பட்னா போன்ற இடங்களில் செயல்படும் trash skimmer, குப்பை நீக்கி இயந்திரம் நீரில் நீந்தியவாறே நீரில் இருக்கும் குப்பைகளை சுத்தம் செய்யும் பணியை மேற்கொள்ளும்.\nஅனைத்து உள்ளாட்சி அமைப்புக்களுக்கும் இது அளிக்கப்பட்டிருக்கிறது இதைத் தொடர்ந்து செயல்படுத்துங்கள், அங்கிருந்து குப்பையை அகற்றுங்கள் என்று அவர்களிடம் வேண்டுகோள் விடுக்கப்பட்டிருக்கிறது. எங்கெல்லாம் நல்ல முறையில் முயற்சி நடைபெறுகிறதோ, அங்கெல்லாம் 3 டன்கள் முதல் 11 டன்கள் வரை தினமும் குப்பைகள் எடுக்கப்படுகின்றன. அந்த அளவுக்கு அசுத்தமடைவது தடுக்கப்பட்டிருக்கிறது என்பது என்னவோ உண்மை தான். இனி வரும் நாட்களில் மேலும் பல இடங்களில் இந்த குப்பை நீக்கி இயந்திரத்தைப் பொருத்தும் திட்டங்கள் செயல்படுத்தப்படும், இதன் பயன்களை கங்கை-யமுனைக்கரையோரமாக வசிக்கும் மக்கள் உடனடியாக அனுபவிப்பார்கள்.\nதொழிற்சாலை மாசுகள் மீது கட்டுப்பாட்டை ஏற்படுத்த காகித தொழிற்சாலை, வடிசாலைகள், சர்க்கரை ஆலைகள் ஆகியவற்றுடன் இணைந்து ஒரு செயல்திட்டம் ஏற்படுத்தப்பட்டிருக்கிறது. ஓரளவு இது செயல்படுத்தப்படவும் தொடங்கி இருக்கிறது. இதன் வாயிலாகவும் நல்ல விளைவுகள் ஏற்படும் என்று என் மனதுக்கு படுகிறது.\nஉத்தராகண்ட், உத்திர பிரதேச மாநிலங்களில் இருக்கும் வடிசாலைகளிலிருந்து வந்த வெளியேற்றங்கள், கடந்த சில நாட்களாக zero liquid discharge, அதாவது பூஜ்யம் திரவ வெளியேற்றம் என்ற நிலையில் வெற்றி பெற்றிருப்பதாக சில அதிகாரிகள் என்னிடம் தெரிவித்திருக்கிறார்கள், இது எனக்கு மிக்க மகிழ்ச்சியை அளிக்கிறது. காகித ஆலைகளிலிருந்து black liquorஇன் வெளியேற்றம் கிட்டத்தட்ட முழுமையாக முடிவுக்கு வந்திருக்கிறது.\nநாம் சரியான திசையில்தான் பயணித்துக் கொண்டிருக்கிறோம் என்பதையே இவை நமக்குக் காட்டுகிறது, ஒரு விழிப்புணர்வு அதிகரிப்பு ஏற்பட்டிருக்கிறது. கங்கைக் கரைகளில் மட்டுமல்ல, தொலைவான தென்னாட்டைச் சேர்ந்த யாராவது சந்திக்க நேர்ந்தாலும், ஐயா, கங்கை தூய்மையாகி விடுமல்லவா என்று அவசியம் கேட்கிறார்கள். வெகுஜனங்களின் நம்பிக்கை சார்ந்த விஷயமான இது, கண்டிப்பாக கங்கையைத் தூய்மைப்படுத்துவதில் வெற்றியைக் கொண்டு சேர்க்கும். கங்கையைத் தூய்மைப்படுத்த மக்கள் தானங்கள் அளித்து வருகிறார்கள். மிக அருமையான முறையில் இந்த அமைப்பு செயல்படுத்தப்பட்டு வருகிறது.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, இன்று ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 24ம் தேதி. இந்தியா இதை பஞ்சாயத் ராஜ் நாளாக கொண்டாடுகிறது. இன்று தான் பஞ்சாயத் ராஜ் அமைப்பு நம் நாட்டில் தொடங்கப்பட்டு, நாளாவட்டத்தில் இந்த அமைப்பு நம் மக்களாட்சி நிர்வாக அமைப்பில், ஒரு மகத்துவம் வாய்ந்த அம்சமாக வெற்றிகரமாகச் செயல்பட்டு வருகிறது. ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 14ம் தேதி பாபா சாஹேப் அம்பேட்கருடைய 125வது பிறந்த நாளை நாம் கொண்டாடினோம், இன்று ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 24ம் தேதி, பஞ்சாயத் ராஜ் நாளைக் கொண்டாடி வருகிறோம்.\nஇது தற்செயலாக நடந்திருக்கும் ஒரு நல்ல விஷயம், எந்த மாமனிதர் நமக்கு இந்திய அரசியலமைப்புச் சட்டத்தை அளித்தாரோ, அவரது பிறந்த நாள் தொடங்கி, அரசியலமைப்புச் சட்டத்தின் மிகப் பெரிய இணைப்பான கிராமங்கள், இவை இரண்டையும் இணைக்கும் கருத்தூக்கமாக இது அமைந்திருப்பதால், இந்திய அரசு மாநில அரசுகளின் ஒத்துழைப்போடு ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 14 தொடங்கி ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 24 வரை பத்து நாட்களுக்கு கிராமோதயம் முதல் பாரத உதயம் வரை என்ற இயக்கத்தை செயல் படுத்தியது. ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 14ம் தேதி பாபா சாஹேப் அம்பேட்கரின் பிறந்த நாளின் போது அவரது பிறந்த இடமான MHOWவில் நான் இருந்தேன் என்பதை பெரும் பேறாகவே கருதுகிறேன். அந்த புனிதமான பூமிக்கு அஞ்சலி செலுத்தும் நல்வாய்ப்பு எனக்குக் கிட்டியது. இன்று ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 24, நமது பெரும்பான்மை பழங்குடி சகோதர சகோதரிகள் வாழும் ஜார்க்கண்டில் பஞ்சாயத் ராஜ் நாளைக் கொண்டாட இருக்கிறேன்,\nஇந்த இயக்கம் மிகப் பெரிய ஒரு விழிப்புணர்வை ஏற்படுத்தி இருக்கிறது. இந்தியாவின் அனைத்து மூலைகளிலும் கிராம அளவில் ஜனநாயக அமைப்புக்களை எவ்வாறு பலப்படுத்துவது? கிராமங்களை எப்படி சுயசார்புடையவைகளாக ஆக்குவது? தங்கள் வளர்ச்சிக்கான திட்டங்களை எப்படி கிராமங்கள் தாங்களே தீட்டிக் கொள்வது? கட்டமைப்புக்கான மகத்துவம், சமூக கட்டமைப்புக்கான மகத்துவம் ஆகியன இருத்தல், கிராமங்களில் பள்ளிப்படிப்பை அரைகுறையாக நிறுத்துவது தடுக்கப்படல், பிள்ளைகள் பள்ளிப் படிப்பை பாதியில் நிறுத்துவதைத் தடுத்தல், பெண் குழந்தையைக் காப்போம், பெண் குழந்தையைப் படிக்க வைப்போம், ஆகியன வெற்றிகரமாக செயல்படுத்தப்பட வேண்டும் என்பதற்காக முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொள்ளப்பட்டன.\nபெண் குழந்தையின் பிறந்த நாள் கிராம விழாவாக கொண்டாடப் பட வேண்டும், சில கிராமங்களில் உணவுதானத் திட்டம் நடைபெற்றிருக்கிறது. இந்தியாவின் பல கிராமங்களில் பலவகையான நிகழ்ச்சிகள் பத்து நாட்களில் நடைபெற்றிருக்கலாம், இது அளவில் குறைவாக இருக்கலாம். மிக அடிப்படையான வழிகளில் புதுமையான முறையில், இத்தனை நாட்களும் கிராமங்களின் நன்மைக்காக, கிராமங்களின் வளர்ச்சிக்காக, ஜனநாயகம் ஆற்றல் பெற, இதை ஒரு சந்தர்ப்பமாகப் பயன்படுத்திக் கொண்ட அனைத்து மாநில அரசுகள், கிராமத் தலைவர்கள் ஆகியோருக்கு என் நல் வாழ்த்துக்களைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன்.\nகிராமங்களிலும் விழிப்புணர்வு ஏற்பட்டிருக்கிறது, அது தான் இந்திய உதயத்துக்கான உத்திரவாதம். பாரத உதயத்தின் ஆதாரம் கிராம உதயத்தில் தான் இருக்கிறது; ஆகையால் கிராம உதயத்தின் மீது நாம் அனைவரும் கவனம் செலுத்தி வருவோம், விரும்பிய பலன்களை அடைந்தே தீருவோம்.\nமும்பையைச் சேர்ந்த ஷர்மிலா (Dhaarpure) தார்புரே அவர்கள் தொலைபேசி வாயிலாக தனது கவலையைத் தெரிவித்திருக்கிறார்: பிரதம மந்திரி அவர்களே, வணக்கங்கள். நான் உங்களிடம் பள்ளி, கல்லூரிக் கல்வி பற்றி வினாவெழுப்ப விரும்புகிறேன். கல்வித் துறையில் கடந்த பல ஆண்டுகளாகவே மேம்பாடு தேவையாக இருந்து வந்திருக்கிறது. போதுமான பள்ளிகளோ கல்லூரிகளோ இல்லாமை அல்லது கல்வித் தரம் இல்லாமை. பிள்ளைகள் தங்கள் கல்வியை நிறைவு செய்தாலும் கூட, பல வேளைகளில் அவர்களுக்கு அடிப்படை விஷயங்கள் பற்றிய அறிவே இல்லாமல் கூட இருக்கிறது. இதனால் நமது குழந்தைகளின் உலகில், ஓட்டத்தில் அவர்கள் எப்போதுமே பின் தங்கி விடுகிறார்கள். இதைப் பற்றிய உங்கள் கருத்து என்ன, இந்தத் துறையில் நீங்கள் எந்த மாதிரியான மாற்றத்தை ஏற்படுத்த விரும்புகிறீர்கள்? இதைப் பற்றி தயவு செய்து எங்களுக்குத் தெரிவியுங்கள். நன்றி.\nஇந்தக் கவலை இயல்பான ஒன்று தான். இன்று ஒவ்வொரு குடும்பத்திலும் தாய் தந்தையருக்கு முதன்மையான கனவு என்று ஒன்று இருக்குமானால், அது குழந்தைகளுக்கு தரமான கல்வி அளிக்க வேண்டும் என்பது தான். வீடு, வாகனம் போன்றவை பற்றிய சிந்தனை எல்லாம் பின்னர் தான். இந்தியா போன்ற நாட்டின் மக்கள் மனங்களில், இந்த உணர்வுதான் மேலோங்கி இருக்கிறது, இது தான் மிகப் பெரிய பலம். குழந்தைகளுக்கு கல்வியளிப்பது, நன்கு படிக்க வைப்பது. நல்ல கல்வி கிடைக்க வேண்டும், இதைப் பற்றி சிந்திக்க வேண்டும் – இது மேலும் அதிகரிக்க வேண்டும், மேலும் விழிப்புணர்வு ஏற்பட வெண்டும். எந்தக் குடும்பங்களில் எல்லாம் இந்த விழிப்புணர்வு இருக்கிறதோ, அதன் தாக்கம் பள்ளிகள் மீதும் ஏற்படுகிறது, ஆசிரியர்கள் மனங்களிலும் ஏற்படுகிறது, நான் இதைப் பெறவே பள்ளி செல்கிறேன் என்று குழந்தைகள் மனதிலும் விழிப்புணர்வு ஏற்படுகிறது. ஆகையால் நான் தாய் தந்தையர் அனைவரிடத்திலும் வைக்கும் விண்ணப்பம், குழந்தைகளிடம் விரிவான முறையில், சற்று நேரம் எடுத்துக் கொண்டு பள்ளிகளின் நடைமுறைகள் பற்றி கலந்து பேசுங்கள் என்பது தான்.\nஏதோ ஒன்று மனதில் எழுந்தால், தாங்களே பள்ளிக்கூடம் சென்று ஆசிரியர்களிடம் வினவுங்கள். இந்த விழிப்புணர்வு தான் நமது கல்வி முறையில் இருக்கும் பல குறைபாடுகளைக் குறைக்க வழி வகுக்கும், மக்களின் பங்களிப்பு இருந்தே ஆக வேண்டும். நமது நாட்டில் அனைத்து அரசுகளும் கல்வி மீது அதிக கவனம் செலுத்தி வந்திருக்கின்றன, ஒவ்வொரு அரசும் தங்களுக்கே உரிய வகையில் முயற்சிகளும் மேற்கொண்டிருக்கிறார்கள். கல்வி நிறுவனங்கள் நிறுவ வேண்டும், கல்வி அமைப்பு விரிவாக்கம் பெற வேண்டும், பள்ளிகள், கல்லூரிகள் ஏற்படுத்தப்பட வேண்டும், ஆசிரியர்கள் சேர்க்கப்பட வேண்டும், அதிகபட்ச குழந்தைகள் பள்ளி செல்ல வேண்டும் என்றே கணிசமான காலம் நமது மக்களின் கவனம் இருந்து வந்துள்ளது என்பதும் உண்மை தான்.\nஒரு வகையில் கல்வியைப் பரப்பும் முயற்சி முதன்மை பெற்று விளங்கியது, இது அவசியமானதும் கூட. ஆனால் விரிவாக்கத்தின் மீது இருந்த முக்கியத்துவம் எந்த அளவுக்கு இருந்ததோ, அதை விட அதிக முக்கியத்துவம் நமது கல்வி முறையில் மேம்பாடு மீதும் இருப்பது அவசியம். விரிவாக்கத்தின் மிகப் பெரிய பணியை நாம் செய்து விட்டோம். இப்போது நாம் தரமான கல்வி மீது முனைப்பு காட்ட வேண்டும். அனைவருக்கும் கல்வி இயக்கம் வாயிலாக இப்போது நல்ல கல்வி அளிக்கப்பட வேண்டும் என்பதே நமது முதன்மை நோக்கமாக வேண்டும். இது வரை கணக்கு வழக்குகள் எல்லாம் அமைப்புகளைச் சார்ந்தே இருந்தன, இப்போது நாம் விளைவுகள் பற்றிய முனைப்பில் கவனம் செலுத்த வேண்டும். இது வரை பள்ளிகளில் எத்தனை பேர் வந்தார்கள் என்பதன் மீது நமது கவனம் இருந்தது, இப்போது பள்ளி செல்லுதலை விட, கற்றல் மீது நாம் அதிக கவனம் செலுத்த வேண்டும். பள்ளியில் சேர்த்தல், சேர்த்தல், சேர்த்தல் – இந்த மந்திரம் தான் சதா சர்வ காலம் ஒலித்து வந்தது, ஆனால் இப்போது எந்தப் பிள்ளைகள் பள்ளிகளுக்கு சென்றிருக்கிறார்களோ, அவர்களுக்கு நல்ல கல்வி, தரமான கல்வி ஆகியவை அளித்தல் மீது நமது குவிமையம் அமைய வேண்டும். தற்போதைய அரசு ஒதுக்கியிருக்கும் நிதி அளவை நீங்கள் கவனித்திருப்பீர்கள். நல்ல கல்வி மீது கவனம் செலுத்தும் வகையில் முயற்சிகள் மேற்கொண்டு வருகிறோம். நாம் நீண்ட நெடிய பயணத்தை மேற்கொண்டாக வேண்டும் என்பது என்னவோ உண்மை தான். ஆனால் 125 கோடி நாட்டு மக்களும் தீர்மானித்து விட்டோம் என்றால், நீண்ட பயணமும் சாத்தியமாகி விடும். ஷர்மிலா அவர்கள் கூறியபடி அடிப்படை மாற்றங்களை நாம் ஏற்படுத்த வேண்டும் என்பது மிகவும் தேவையாக இருக்கிறது.\nஇந்த முறை நாம் வாடிக்கையான நடைமுறையிலிருந்து விலகி பணியாற்றி இருக்கிறோம் என்பதை நீங்கள் கவனித்திருக்கலாம். பட்ஜெட்டிலேயே, பத்து அரசு பல்கலைக்கழகங்கள், பத்து தனியார் பல்கலைக்கழகங்கள் ஆகியவற்றுக்கு அரசுக் கட்டுப்பாடுகளிலிருந்து விலக்களித்து, போட்டிகள் நிறைந்த பாதையைத் தேர்ந்தெடுக்கலாம் என்று கூறப்பட்டிருக்கிறது. நீங்கள் தலை சிறந்த பல்கலைக் கழகமாக ஆக என்ன செய்ய விரும்புகிறீர்கள் என்பதைக் கூறுங்கள் என்று சொல்லியிருக்கிறோம். அவர்களுக்கு முழு சுதந்திரம் அளிக்கும் வகையில் திட்டம் ஏற்படுத்தப்பட்டிருக்கிறது. இந்தியாவின் பல்கலைக் கழகங்களும் உலக அளவில் போட்டி போடும் திறன் படைத்த பல்கலைக் கழகங்களாக ஆக முடியும், ஆகவும் வேண்டும். கல்விக்கான முக்கியத்துவம் எந்த அளவுக்கு இருக்கிறதோ, அதே அளவு முக்கியத்துவம் திறன்களுக்கும் இருக்கிறது, அதே போல கல்வியில் தொழில்நுட்பத்தின் பங்கு மகத்தானதாக இருக்கப் போகிறது. தொலைதூரக் கல்வி, தொழில்நுட்பம் – இவை தாம் நமது கல்வியை எளிதாக்கும், சில காலத்திலேயே இதன் பலன்கள் கண்களுக்குப் புலப்படத் தொடங்கும் என்று எனக்கு நம்பிக்கை இருக்கிறது.\nநீண்ட காலமாக ஒரு விஷயம் பற்றி மக்கள் என்னிடம் கேட்டு வருகிறார்கள், சிலர் இணையதளமான mygovஇல் எழுதியும் இருக்கிறார்கள், சிலரோ narendramodiappஇல் தெரிவித்திருக்கிறார்கள், பல இளைஞர்கள் எழுதியிருக்கிறார்கள்.\nபிரதமர் அவர்களே வணக்கங்கள். நான் பிஜ்னோரிலிருந்து மோனா கர்ணவால் பேசுகிறேன். இன்றைய கால கட்டத்தில் இளைஞர்களுக்கு கல்வியோடு கூட விளையாட்டும் அதிக மகத்துவமானதாக இருக்கிறது. அவற்றில் team spirit, குழு உணர்வு இருத்தல் அவசியம், நல்ல தலைவராக ஆகும் இயல்பும் இருத்தல் வேண்டும், இதன் மூலமாக அவர்களின் முழுமையான வளர்ச்சி ஏற்படும். இதை நான் என் அனுபவம் வாயிலாகக் கூறுகிறேன், ஏனென்றால், நான் பாரத சாரண சாரணியர் அமைப்பில் இருந்திருக்கிறேன், இது என் வாழ்வில் நல்ல தாக்கத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி இருக்கிறது. நீங்கள் அதிக அளவில் இளைய சமுதாயத்துக்கு கருத்தூக்கம் அளிக்க வேண்டும் என்று நான் விரும்புகிறேன். அரசும் கூட அதிக அளவில் தேசிய மாணவர் படை, நாட்டு நலப்பணித் திட்டம், பாரத் சாரண சாரணியர் அமைப்பு ஆகியவற்றுக்கு ஊக்கம் அளிக்க வேண்டும் என்று நான் விரும்புகிறேன்.\nநீங்கள் எல்லோரும் எனக்கு ஏகப்பட்ட ஆலோசனைகளை அளித்திருக்கிறீர்கள், இதைப் பார்த்த பிறகு, உங்களிடம் உரையாடும் முன்பாக, இந்த அமைப்புக்களிடம் நான் பேச வெண்டும் என்று எனக்குத் தோன்றியது. நீங்கள் அளித்த அழுத்தம் காரணமாக, உங்களின் ஆலோசனைகள் காரணமாக, நான் இப்போது ஒரு கூட்டத்தை கூட்டினேன், அதில் தேசிய மாணவர் படையின் தலைவர் இருந்தார், நாட்டு நலப்பணித் திட்டம், சாரண சாரணியர் அமைப்பு, செஞ்சிலுவை சங்கம், நேரு யுவ கேந்திரம் ஆகியவற்றைச் சேர்ந்தவர்கள் பங்கெடுத்தார்கள். இதற்கு முன்பாக நீங்கள் எப்போது சந்தித்தீர்கள் என்று அவர்களிடம் வினவிய போது, இல்லை இல்லை, நாடு சுதந்திரம் அடைந்த பிறகு, இப்போது தான் முதன் முறையாக இது போன்றதொரு கூட்டம் நடைபெறுகிறது என்றார்கள் அவர்கள்.\nமுதன்மையாக இந்த அனைத்து பணிகள் குறித்து என் மீது அழுத்தம் அளித்த அத்துணை இளைய நண்பர்களுக்கு என் வணக்கங்களைத் தெரிவிக்கிறேன். இதன் விளைவாகத்தான் இந்தக் கூட்டத்துக்கு ஏற்பாடு செய்யப்பட்டது, இந்த சந்திப்பினால் நன்மை விளைந்தது என்று கருதுகிறேன். அதிக அளவு ஒருங்கிணைப்பு இதற்கு தேவைப்பட்டது. அவரவர்கள் தத்தமது முறையில் நிறைய வேலைகளைச் செய்கிறார்கள், ஆனால் சமூக ரீதியாக, ஒருங்கிணைந்த முறையில் நமது பல்வேறு அமைப்புகள் பணியாற்றும் போது மகத்தான விளைவை ஏற்படுத்த முடியும், இல்லையா? அவர்களின் வீச்சு பரந்ததாக இருக்கிறது, பல குடும்பங்களைச் சென்று அவர்கள் அடைந்திருக்கிறார்கள்.\nஇவர்களின் இந்த அளவு பரவலாக்கம் எனக்கு மன நிறைவை அளித்தது. அவர்களிடம் அதிக உற்சாகம் காணப்பட்டது, ஏதாவது செய்தாக வேண்டும். நானே ஒரு காலத்தில் தேசிய மாணவர் படையில் கேடட்டாக இருந்திருக்கிறேன், இவை போன்ற அமைப்புக்கள் மூலம் புதிய கண்ணோட்டம் பிறக்கிறது என்பதை நான் அறிவேன், ஒரு தேசிய கண்ணோட்டம் ஏற்படுகிறது என்பது உண்மை. என் சிறுபிராயத்தில் நான் நன்மைகளை அனுபவித்தேன், இந்த அமைப்புக்களில் ஒரு புதிய சக்தியை நிரப்ப வேண்டும், புதிய ஊக்கத்தை அளிக்க வேண்டும். இந்த முறை நான் அவர்கள் முன்னிலையில் சில விஷயங்களை வைத்திருக்கிறேன்.\nஇந்தப் பருவ காலத்தில், நமது இளைஞர்களும், அனைத்து அமைப்பினரும் நீர் சேமிக்கும் மகத்தான பணியில் ஏன் ஈடுபடக் கூடாது என்று வினவினேன். எத்தனை வட்டங்கள், எத்தனை மாவட்டங்களில் திறந்த வெளியில் மலஜலம் கழிப்பதை நம்மால் தடுக்க முடியும். எப்படி திறந்த வெளி மலஜலம் கழிப்பதிலிருந்து விடுதலை அளிக்க முடியும்? நாட்டை இணைக்க எந்த மாதிரியான திட்டங்களை ஏற்படுத்தலாம், அனைத்து அமைப்புக்களின் பொதுவான இளைஞர்கள் பாடல் என்னவாக இருக்க முடியும்? என அவர்களிடம் பல விஷயங்கள் குறித்து கலந்துரையாடினோம்.\nநம்மிடையே இளைஞர்களுக்கான பலவகையான அமைப்புக்கள் இருக்கின்றன. அவற்றின் செயல்முறை, திட்டங்கள் ஆகியவற்றில் என்ன மாதிரியான புதிய விஷயங்களை நம்மால் இணைக்க முடியும் என்பது குறித்து நீங்கள் எனக்கு மிகச் சரியான ஆலோசனை வழங்குங்கள் என்று நான் உங்கள் அனைவரிடமும் விண்ணப்பித்துக் கொள்கிறேன். என் narendramodiappஇல் நீங்கள் எழுதினால், நான் அதை சரியான இடத்துக்கு கொண்டு சேர்க்கிறேன், இந்த சந்திப்புக்குப் பிறகு, அமைப்புக்களின் செயல்பாட்டு வேகம் அதிகரிக்கும் என்று நான் கருதுகிறேன், நீங்களுமே உங்களை அவர்களோடு இணைத்துக் கொள்ள விரும்புவீர்கள், இந்த மாதிரியான ஒரு நிலை ஏற்படும் என்று நான் நம்புகிறேன்.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, இன்று நாமனைவரும் சிந்திக்க வேண்டிய கட்டாயம் இருக்கும் விஷயம் பற்றி நான் பேச வேண்டி இருக்கிறது. இதை நான் அதிர்ச்சியளிக்கும் விஷயமாகவும் பார்க்கிறேன். எந்தக் கட்சி எத்தனை எரிவாயு சிலிண்டர்களை அளிக்கும் என்பது கடந்த பல தேர்தல்களின் விவாதப் பொருளாக அமைந்திருந்தது என்ற அளவில், நமது நாட்டின் அரசியல் நிலைமை இருந்தது என்பதை நீங்கள் நன்கறிவீர்கள். 12 சிலிண்டரா இல்லை 9 சிலிண்டரா? இது தான் மிகப் பெரிய தேர்தல் விஷயமாக இருந்து வந்தது. ஒவ்வொரு அரசியல் கட்சியும், மத்தியதட்டு மக்களை தேர்தல் கண்ணோட்டத்திலேயே அணுக வேண்டும் என்று எண்ணியதால், எரிவாயு சிலிண்டர் மிகப் பெரிய விஷயமாக ஆனது. மற்றொரு புறம், மானியங்களைக் குறையுங்கள் என்று பொருளாதார வல்லுனர்கள் அழுத்தம் அளித்து வந்தார்கள், இதன் காரணமாக பல குழுக்கள் ஏற்படுத்தப்பட்டு, அவை மானியக் குறைப்பு பற்றிய ஆலோசனைகளையும் முடிவுகளையும் அளித்தன. இந்தக் குழுக்கள் செயல்பாட்டில் பல கோடி ரூபாய் செலவானது. ஆனால் நிலைமையில் எந்த முன்னேற்றமும் காணப்படவில்லை. இது அனைவருக்கும் பொதுவான அனுபவமாக விளங்கியது. இதைத் தாண்டி யாருமே சிந்திக்கவில்லை.\nஇன்று நாட்டுமக்களே, உங்கள் முன்பாக கணக்கு காட்டுவதில் எனக்கு மிக்க மகிழ்ச்சியாக இருக்கிறது. நான் 3வது வழிமுறையை மேற்கொண்டேன், மக்களின் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைக்கும் பாதை தான் அது. சில சமயங்களில் அரசியலில் ஈடுபட்டிருக்கும் எங்களைப் போன்றவர்கள் தங்களை விட, தங்களைச் சார்ந்தவர்கள் மீது அதிக நம்பிக்கை வைக்க வேண்டும். நான் மக்கள் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைத்தேன், நீங்கள் ஓராண்டு செலவினமாக 1500 முதல் 2000 ரூபாய் வரை ஏற்றுக் கொள்ள முடியுமானால், நீங்கள் ஏன் எரிவாயு மானியத்தைத் துறக்கக் கூடாது, இது ஏதாவது ஒரு ஏழைக்கு உதவியாக இருக்குமே என்று இயல்பான வேண்டுகோள் விடுத்தேன். ஆனால் இன்று என் நாட்டு மக்கள் மீது கொண்ட பெருமிதத்தால் என் நெஞ்சு விம்முகிறது. ஒரு கோடி மக்கள், தாமே முன்வந்து தங்கள் எரிவாயு மானியத்தைத் துறந்திருக்கிறார்கள், இந்த ஒரு கோடிப் பேர்கள் அனைவருமே சீமான்கள் அல்ல. இதில் ஓய்வு பெற்ற ஆசிரியர்கள், ஓய்வு பெற்ற குமாஸ்தாக்கள், விவசாயிகள், சிறிய கடை வைத்திருப்பவர்கள் என இவர்களில் மத்திய தட்டு மக்கள், கீழ் மத்திய தட்டு மக்கள் இருக்கிறார்கள்; இவர்கள் இந்த மானியத்தைத் துறந்திருக்கிறார்கள்.\nஇரண்டாவது சிறப்பைப் பாருங்கள், இந்த மானியத்தை அவர்கள் மொபைல் app மூலமாகவோ, ஆன்லைன் மூலமாகவோ, தொலைபேசியில் மிஸ்ட் கால் தருவதன் மூலமாகவோ, பல வழிகளில் செய்திருக்கலாம். ஆனால் கணக்குப் பார்த்தால், இந்த ஒரு கோடிப் பேர்களில் 80 சதவீதத்துகும் அதிகமானோர் தாங்களே விநியோகஸ்தர்களிடம் சென்றார்கள், வரிசையில் நின்றார்கள், எழுத்து வடிவத்தில் கொடுத்து தங்கள் மானியத்தைத் துறந்தார்கள்.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, இது சிறிய விஷயம் அல்ல. அரசு ஏதோ ஒரு வரிவிதிப்பில் சற்று விலக்கு அளித்தால், வாரம் முழுவதும் தொலைக்காட்சிகளிலும், செய்தித் தாள்களிலும் அந்த அரசுக்கு பாராட்டு மழை வந்து குவியும். ஒரு கோடி குடும்பங்கள் மானியத்தைக் கைவிட்டிருக்கின்றன, பார்க்கப் போனால் நம் நாட்டில் மானியங்கள் ஒரு வகையில் உரிமையாகவே ஆகியிருக்கின்றன, அப்படிப்பட்ட மானியத்தைக் கைவிட்டிருக்கிறார்கள். நான் முதன் முதலாக, அந்த ஒரு கோடிக் குடும்பங்களுக்கும் என் பல நூறு வணக்கங்களைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன், வாழ்த்துக்களைக் காணிக்கையாக்குகிறேன். ஏனென்றால் இவர்கள் அரசியல் தலைவர்களை புதிய கண்ணோட்டத்தில் சிந்திக்க வேண்டிய கட்டாயத்துக்கு ஆட்படுத்தி இருக்கிறார்கள். இந்த ஒரு நிகழ்வே கூட, நாட்டின் பொருளாதார வல்லுனர்களை புதிய கண்ணோட்டத்தில் சிந்திக்கும் கட்டாயத்துக்குத் தள்ளியிருக்கிறது. பலவகையான சாத்தியக்கூறுகளை முன்வைக்கும் உலகின் பொருளாதார வல்லுனர்களுக்குமே கூட, இது அவர்களின் எண்ணப்பாட்டுக்கு அப்பாற்பட்ட நிகழ்வாக அமைந்திருக்கிறது. இது பற்றி ஏதாவது ஒரு கட்டத்தில் சிந்தித்தாக வேண்டும். ஒரு கோடிக் குடும்பங்கள் மானியத்தைக் கைவிடுவது என்பதும், அவர்களுக்கு பதிலாக ஒரு கோடி ஏழைக் குடும்பங்களுக்கு எரிவாயு சிலிண்டர்கள் கிடைப்பது என்பதும், ஒரு கோடிக் குடும்பங்கள் மானியத்தைத் துறந்ததால் மிச்சமாகும் நிதி என்பதும், மேலோட்டமாகப் பார்க்கும் போது சாதாரணமான விஷயமாகத் தோன்றினாலும், மக்கள் மீது நம்பிக்கை கொண்டு செயலாற்றும் போது எந்த அளவுக்கு சாதிக்க முடியும் என்பதையே காட்டுகிறது, இது தான் அசாதாரணமான விஷயம். நாம் எங்கெல்லாம் செல்கிறோமோ, அங்கெல்லாம் மக்கள் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைத்து கண்டிப்பாக ஒரு விஷயத்தையாவது கூற வேண்டும் என்று நான் அனைத்து அரசியல் தலைவர்களிடமும் வலியுறுத்திக் கேட்டுக் கொள்கிறேன். நீங்கள் சிந்தித்துக் கூட பார்க்க முடியாத பலன்கள் உங்களுக்குக் கிட்டும். நாம் இந்தத் திசையில் பயணிக்க வேண்டும். எடுத்துக்காட்டாக, 3ம் நிலை, 4ம் நிலைப் பணியாளர்களுக்கு ஏன் நேர்முகத் தேர்வு நடத்த வேண்டும், அவர்களின் தேர்வு மதிப்பெண்கள் மீது நாம் ஏன் நம்பிக்கை வைக்கக் கூடாது என்று ஏதோ என் மனதில் எண்ணம் உதித்தது. சில இரயில் தடங்களில் டிக்கட் பரிசோதகர்கள் இருக்க மாட்டார்கள் என்று அறிவிப்பு செய்யலாமே என்று கூட என் மனதில் எண்ணம் எழுகிறது. செய்து தான் பார்க்கலாமே! நாட்டு மக்கள் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைப்போமே! இப்படி பல பரிசோதனைகளை செய்து பார்க்கலாம். ஒரு முறை நாம் நாட்டு மக்கள் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைத்து விட்டால், அபாரமான பலன்கள் கிட்டும். ஏதோ என் மனதுக்குப் பட்டதைக் கூறி வைத்தேன், அவ்வளவு தான். இதை யாரும் அரசின் விதிமுறையாக ஆக்க முடியாது. ஆனால் சூழலை என்னவோ ஏற்படுத்தலாம். அல்லவா? இந்த சூழலை ஏதோ அரசியல் தலைவர்கள் ஏற்படுத்தவில்லை, நாட்டின் ஒரு கோடி குடும்பங்கள் ஏற்படுத்தி இருக்கின்றன.\nரவி என்ற ஒருவர் எனக்கு கடிதம் எழுதியிருக்கிறார் – good news everyday, தினமும் நல்ல சேதி. ஒவ்வொரு நாளும் ஒரு நல்ல விஷயம் பற்றித் தெரிவிக்க வேண்டும் என்று உங்கள் அதிகாரிகளுக்குக் கூறுங்கள். ஒவ்வொரு செய்தித் தாளிலும், ஊடகத்திலும் மோசமான செய்தி தான் breaking newsஆக தெரிவிக்கப்படுகிறது. 125 கோடி மக்கள் கொண்ட நமது நாட்டில் எந்த ஒரு நல்ல விஷயமும் நடப்பதில்லையா? தயவு செய்து இந்த நிலையை மாற்றுங்கள் என்று ரவி அவர்கள் தன் ஆதங்கத்தை வெளிப்படுத்தி இருக்கிறார்.\nரவி அவர்கள் தன் கோபத்தை வெளிப்படுத்தி இருக்கிறார், அவர் என் மீது கோபம் கொள்ளவில்லை என்று நான் நினைக்கிறேன், நிலைமை மீது கோபம் கொண்டிருக்கிறார். இந்தியாவின் காலஞ்சென்ற முன்னாள் குடியரசுத் தலைவர் APJ Abdul Kalam அவர்கள் செய்தித் தாள்களின் முதல் பக்கத்தில் நல்ல செய்திகளையே அச்சிடுங்கள் என்று எப்போதும் கூறி வந்திருக்கிறார். சில நாட்கள் முன்பாக ஒரு செய்தித் தாள் எனக்கு கடிதம் கூட அனுப்பி இருந்தது. நாங்கள் திங்கட்கிழமையன்று ஒரு மோசமான செய்தியையும் கூட வெளியிட மாட்டோம், ஆக்கபூர்வமான செய்தியையே வெளியிடுவோம் என்று தெரிவித்திருந்தார்கள். இப்போதெல்லாம் சில மின்னூடகங்கள் ஆக்கபூர்வமான செய்திகளுக்கென்றே குறிப்பிட்ட நேரத்தை ஒதுக்கி இருப்பதை நான் பார்க்கிறேன். ஆக்கபூர்வமான செய்திகளுக்கான சூழல் ஏற்பட்டிருக்கிறது என்பது என்னவோ உண்மை தான். நல்ல செய்திகள், உண்மையான செய்திகள் அனைவருக்கும் கிடைக்க வேண்டும் என்று எல்லோரும் உணர்கிறார்கள். ஒரு பிரபலமான நபர் என்ன தான் சிறப்பான தகவலை அளித்தாலும், அதை எத்தனை அழகான சொற்கள் வாயிலாகத் தெரிவித்தாலும், அருமையான முறையில் விளக்கினாலும் அதை விட அதிக பலன் நல்ல செய்தியின் மூலம் கிடைக்கிறது. நல்ல செய்தி நல்ல செயல்களுக்கு கருத்தூக்கமாக அமைகிறது. எந்த அளவுக்கு நாம் நன்மைக்கு வலு கூட்டுகிறோமோ, அந்த அளவுக்கு தீயவைகளுக்கான இடம் குறைகிறது என்பது சத்தியம். நாம் தீபத்தை ஏற்றினால், இருள் தாமாகவே விலகி விடும், கண்டிப்பாக விலகும். அரசு தரப்பில் Transforming India என்ற பெயரிலான ஒரு இணைய தளத்தை செயல்படுத்தி வருகிறோம். இதில் ஆக்கபூர்வமான செய்திகள் வெளிவருகின்றன. அரசின் ஆக்கபூர்வமான செயல்பாடுகள் மட்டுமல்ல, மக்களின் நல்ல பணிகளும் இடம் பெறுகிறது, இந்த portalஇல் நீங்களும் கூட ஏதாவது நல்ல செய்தி இருந்தால், அனுப்பி வைக்கலாம். நீங்களும் அதில் பங்களிப்பு நல்க முடியும். ரவி அவர்களே, நீங்கள் நல்ல ஆலோசனையை அளித்திருக்கிறீர்கள். ஆனால் தயவு செய்து என் மீது கோபம் கொள்ளாதீர்கள். நாமனைவருமாக இணைந்து ஆக்கபூர்வமான முயற்சிகளில் ஈடுபடுவோம், ஆக்கபூர்வமானவற்றைப் பேசப் பழகுவோம், ஆக்கப்பூர்வமானவற்றைக் கொண்டு செல்லும் முயற்சிகளில் பங்கெடுப்போம்.\nகும்ப மேளா நமது நாட்டின் சிறப்பு. கும்ப மேளா சுற்றுலா ஈர்ப்பு மையமாக ஆக முடியும். நதிக் கரையில், பல நாட்களுக்கு கோடிக்கணக்கான மனிதர்கள் வந்து குழுமுகிறார்கள் என்பது உலக மக்களில் பல பேர்களுக்குத் தெரியாமலே இருந்துள்ளது. அமைதியான மனதோடு, அமைதி நிறைந்த சூழலில் விழா நிறைவடைகிறது. இந்த நிகழ்வுகள் அமைப்பு ரீதியாக, நிகழ்ச்சி மேலாண்மைக் கோணத்தில், மக்களின் பங்கெடுப்பு என்ற வகையில், மிகப் பெரிய தரமட்டங்களை சாதிக்கிறது. சிம்ஹஸ்த கும்ப மேளா தொடர்பான படங்களை பலர் தரவேற்றம் செய்து வருவதை கடந்த இரு நாட்களாக நான் கவனித்து வருகிறேன். இந்திய அரசின் சுற்றுலாத் துறை, மாநில அரசுகளின் சுற்றுலாத் துறைகள் இதையொட்டி புகைப்படப் போட்டியை நடத்த வேண்டும் என்று நான் விரும்புகிறேன். மிகச் சிறப்பான புகைப்படங்களை நீங்கள் தரவேற்றம் செய்யுங்கள் என்று மக்களிடம் கேட்டுக் கொள்ளலாம். சூழலில் பெரிய மாற்றத்தை நாம் காண முடியும், அதே வேளையில் கும்ப மேளா விழாவின் போது எத்தனை வேறுபட்ட விஷயங்கள் நடக்கின்றன என்று மக்களுக்கும் தெரிய வரும். இதைக் கண்டிப்பாக செய்ய முடியும். இடையில் மத்திய பிரதேச முதல்வர் என்னை சந்தித்த போது, தூய்மையின் மீது சிறப்பு கவனம் செலுத்தப்பட்டிருப்பதாக என்னிடம் தெரிவித்தார். தூய்மை என்பது இந்த விழாவின் போது மட்டுமல்ல, அங்கிருந்து தூய்மை பற்றிய கருத்தை மக்கள் தங்கள் மனங்களில் சுமந்து செல்ல வேண்டும் என்பதே நோக்கம். கும்ப மேளா சமயம், ஆன்மீகம் தொடர்பான ஒரு விழா என்பதை நான் ஏற்றுக் கொள்ளும் அதே வேளையில், அதுவே கூட ஒரு சமுதாய வாய்ப்பாக ஆக முடியும் என்று நான் கருதுகிறேன். இதை நல்ல பழக்கங்கள் ஏற்படும் வாய்ப்பாகவும் ஆக்க முடியும். அங்கிருந்து நல்ல தீர்மானங்கள், நல்ல பழக்கங்கள் ஆகியவற்றை கிராமம் தோறும் கொண்டு சேர்க்கும் காரணியாகவும் அதை உருமாற்ற முடியும். தண்ணீரின் மீது எப்படி நமது நேசத்தை அதிகரிக்கலாம், நீரை எப்படி நாம் போற்றலாம், தண்ணீர் சேகரிப்பு தொடர்பான செய்தியை ஆகியவற்றைப் பரப்ப கும்ப மேளாவை நாம் பயன்படுத்திக் கொள்ளலாம்.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, பஞ்சாயத்து ராஜின் இந்த மகத்துவபூர்வமான தினத்தன்று எனது அளப்பரிய நன்றிகளைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன். எப்போதும் போலவே இப்போதும் உங்கள் மனதின் குரல்களோடு எனது மனதின் குரலும் பிரிக்க முடியாதவையாக ஒலித்தன. இது எனக்கு ஆனந்தம் அளிக்கிறது. மீண்டும் ஒரு முறை பலப்பல நன்றிகள்!!\n"

        "article": "\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌ వాసులారా..\nన‌మ‌స్కారం.\nఇప్పుడు వేసవి కాలం. ప్రతి ఒక్కరు ఎండాకాలం సెల‌వుల కోసం ప్రణాళికలు సిద్ధం చేసుకొంటారు. ఇది మామిడి పండ్ల కాలం కూడా కావడంతో, ఈ ఫలాలను రుచి చూడాల‌ని మనం తపిస్తాం. ఒక్కొక్క సారి మధ్యాహ్నం పూట కొంచెం సేపు కునుకు తీస్తే భలేగా ఉంటుందని మనకు అనిపిస్తుంది. కానీ, ఈ సంవత్సరం ఎండలు ఎక్కువై ఉక్కబోత అందరి వినోదాన్నీ నాశనం చేసింది.\nఎడతెగని వేడిమిని గురించి జాతి ఆందోళన చెందడమనేది ఎంతో సహజమైందే. అంతకు మించి, గత రెండు సంవత్సరాలుగా వరుసగా దుర్భిక్షం ఎదురవడంతో, మామూలుగా నీరు నిల్వ ఉండే ప్రదేశాలపై ప్రతికూల ప్రభావం పడింది. కొన్ని సార్లు కబ్జా కార‌ణంగా, మరికొన్ని సార్లు ఇసుక మేట వేసిన కార‌ణంగా, జలాశయాలలోకి, ఇంకా ఇతర జల వనరులలోకి వచ్చే నీటి ప్ర‌వాహానికి అడ్డంకి ఏర్పడింది. ఫలితంగా, జలాశయాలు వాటి సామర్థ్యం కన్నా తక్కువగా మాత్రమే నీటిని నిల్వ ఉంచగలుగుతున్నాయి. ఇంకా అథమమైన విషయం ఏమిటంటే, ఇదే చక్రభ్రమణం ఏళ్ల తరబడి కొనసాగుతూ ఉండటం. దీనితో ఈ జలాశయాల సామర్థ్యం క్రమంగా తగ్గిపోయింది. కరవు సమస్యను పరిష్కరించడానికి, జల సంక్షోభం నుంచి ఉపశమనం కలిగించడానికి, ప్రభుత్వాలు ప్రయత్నాలు చేస్తున్నాయి. కానీ ఇదొక్కటే కాదు.. పరిస్థితిని ఎదురించడానికి పౌరులు అభినందనీయమైన కృషికి న‌డుంక‌డుతున్నారు. అనేక గ్రామాలలో ఇప్పుడు చైత‌న్యవ కనుపిస్తోంది. నీటి కొరతను అనుభవించిన వారే జలం సిసలైన విలువను తెలుసుకోగలుగుతారు. కాబట్టి, ఇటువంటి చోట్ల వారు నీళ్ల విషయంలో ఎంతో జాగ్రత్తలతో ఉంటారు; ఇంకా, నీటి కరవును తట్టుకోవడానికి ఏదో ఒక‌టి చేయ‌డంలో జ‌రుగుతుంది.\nఇటీవలే ఎవ‌రో నాతో చెప్పారు.. మహారాష్ట్ర‌లోని అహ్మ‌ద్‌న‌గ‌ర్ జిల్లా హివ్ రేబ‌జార్ గ్రామ‌ పంచాయ‌తీలో ఆ గ్రామస్తులు నీటి కొర‌త‌ను ప్రధానమైన, ఎంతో సున్నిత‌మైన సమస్యగా ఎంచి ప‌రిష్క‌రించుకున్నారని. నీటిని నిల్వ చేయాలనే ఆస‌క్తి వ్యక్తమయ్యే పల్లెలను ఎవరైనా అనేకంగా చూడవచ్చు. హివ్ రేబ‌జార్ లో వ్యవసాయదారులు పంటలు విత్తే రీతిని మార్చి అ సమస్యను పరిష్కరించారు. నీరు అధికంగా అవసరమయ్యే పంట‌లను.. అంటే చెర‌కు, అర‌టి వంటివి సాగు చేయడాన్ని మానివేయాలని వారు నిర్ణయించుకొన్నారు. విన‌డానికి ఇది చాలా సుల‌భంగా ఉన్నా, కానీ వాస్తవంలో ఇది అంత‌ సుల‌భం కాదు. ఇది ఎంత‌ పెద్ద సమష్టి నిర్ణయం అయి ఉంటుందో? ఎవరైనా నీటిని ఎక్కువగా వాడే క‌ర్మాగారాల యజమానులకు అటువంటి జల వినియోగం పర్యవసానాలను గురించి చెప్పి వారి యూనిట్లను మూసివేయవలసిందిగా అభ్యర్థిస్తే వచ్చే ప్రతిస్పందన ఎలా ఉంటుందదో ఎవరైనా ఇట్టే ఊహించవచ్చు. అయితే ఈ రైతు సోదరుల వివేకాన్ని చూడండి. చెర‌కు పంట‌ సేద్యానికి బోలెడంత నీరు కావలసి వస్తుందని గ్రహించారు కాబట్టి ఆ పంటను వేయవద్దని వారు అనుకొని, అదే ఆలోచనను అమలులో పెట్టారు. చెరకు కాకుండా పండ్లు, కాయగూరల వంటి ఎంతో తక్కువ నీరు ఉపయోగించుకొనే పంటలను వేస్తున్నారు. స్ప్రింక్లర్‌ లు, బిందు సేద్యం మెలకువలు, వాటర్ హార్వెస్టింగ్, వాట‌ర్ రీఛార్జింగ్.. ఇలా అనేక ర‌కాల కార్యక్రమాలను వారు అనుసరించారు. ఇవాళ వారి గ్రామం నీటి స‌మ‌స్యకు ఎదురొడ్డి నిలువగలిగే శ‌క్తి ని సంతరించుకొంది. నేను హివ్ రేబ‌జార్ లాంటి చిన్న ఊరిని గురించి చెప్తుండవచ్చు అయితే, ఇటువంటి గ్రామాలు ఇంకా ఎన్నో ఉండే ఉంటాయి. అటువంటి గ్రామాల నివాసులకు వారు చేస్తున్న మంచి పనికి గాను నేను వారికి నా హృద‌య‌పూర్వ‌క‌మైన‌ అభినందనలను తెలియజేస్తున్నాను.\nనాకు ఎవ‌రో చెప్పారు, మ‌ధ్య‌ ప్ర‌దేశ్‌లోని దేవాస్ జిల్లాలో గోర్ వా గ్రామ‌ పంచాయ‌తీ ఉంద‌ని. ఈ పంచాయ‌తీ ప్ర‌య‌త్నం చేసి పంట‌ చెరువును ఏర్పాటు చేయ‌డానికి ఒక కార్య‌క్ర‌మాన్ని చేప‌ట్టింది. దాదాపు 27 పంట‌ చెరువులను త‌యారు చేశారు. ఇందువ‌ల్ల భూగ‌ర్భ జ‌లాల స్థాయి ఎంత‌గానో పెరిగింది. నీరు పైకి వ‌చ్చింది. పంట‌కు ఎప్పుడు సాగు నీరు అవ‌స‌ర‌మైనా, నీరు ల‌భించేది. సుమారు 20 శాతం వారి వ్య‌వ‌సాయ ఉత్పాద‌న పెరిగింది. అలా నీరైతే పొదుపు అయ్యింది. ఎప్పుడైతే నీటి స్థాయి పైకి వ‌స్తుందో.. అప్పుడు నీటి నాణ్య‌త‌లో కూడా ఎంతో మార్పు వ‌స్తుంది. స్వ‌చ్ఛ‌మైన తాగు నీరు GDP వృద్ధికి కూడా కార‌ణం అవుతుంద‌ని అంటారు. ఆరోగ్యం అయితే త‌ప్ప‌కుండా మెరుగ‌వుతుంది.\nభార‌త ప్ర‌భుత్వ రైల్వే ద్వారా నీరు లాతూర్‌కు చేరుతుంద‌ని తెలిసిన‌ప్పుడు ఇది ప్ర‌పంచానికి ఒక వార్త అవుతుంది. ఇది నిజ‌మే. ఎంత‌ వేగంగా రైల్వే ఈ ప‌ని చేసింది. ఇది త‌ప్ప‌కుండా అభినంద‌నీయ‌మే. అయితే ఆ గ్రామ‌ ప్ర‌జ‌లు కూడా అంతే అభినంద‌నీయులే. ప్ర‌జ‌ల ద్వారా అమ‌ల్లోకి వ‌చ్చే ఇలాంటి యోచ‌న‌లు మ‌న‌కు క‌నిపించ‌వు. ప్ర‌భుత్వం చేసే ప‌నుల గురించి మంచి మాట‌లు అప్పుడ‌ప్పుడు మ‌న‌ ముందుకు వ‌స్తుంటాయి. కానీ మ‌న చుట్టుప‌క్క‌ల ఎంతో మంది అనావృష్టిని ఎదుర్కొనేందుకు ఎన్ని ర‌కాల ప్ర‌య‌త్నాలు చేస్తున్నారో ప‌రిష్కారం కోసం ఎలా కొత్త‌ కొత్త ప‌ద్ధ‌తులను అవ‌లంబిస్తున్నారో మ‌న‌కు గోచ‌రిస్తుంది.\nమ‌నిషి ఎంత క‌ష్టంలో ఉన్న‌ప్ప‌టికీ ఎక్క‌డో మంచి జ‌రిగింద‌న్న ఒక శుభ వార్త అంద‌గానే త‌న క‌ష్ట‌మంతా దూర‌మైయింద‌న్న‌ట్టు ఊర‌ట పొంద‌డం స‌హజంగా జ‌రుగుతూ ఉంటుంది. ఈ సారి వ‌ర్షాకాలంలో 106 శాతం నుంచి 110 శాతం వ‌ర‌కు ఎక్కువ‌గా వ‌ర్ష‌పాతం న‌మోదుకావ‌చ్చున‌ని ఎప్పుడైతే సూచ‌న వ‌చ్చిందో వెంట‌నే అంద‌రూ ఒక శాంతి సందేశం పొందిన‌ట్టుగా ఆనందించారు. వ‌ర్షాలు కుర‌వ‌డానికి ఇంకా స‌మ‌యం ఉన్న‌ప్ప‌టికీ వ‌ర్షాకాలం బాగుంటుంద‌న్న స‌మాచార‌మే ఎంతో సంతోషాన్ని, చైత‌న్యాన్ని క‌లిగించింది. కానీ ప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ వాసులారా.. మంచి వ‌ర్షాలు ప‌డ‌తాయ‌నే ఈ స‌మాచారం ఎంత ఆనందాన్ని ఇస్తుందో మ‌నంద‌రికీ అంతే స్థాయిలో ఒక హెచ్చ‌రిక‌ను కూడా ఇస్తుంది. మ‌నం ప్ర‌తి గ్రామంలో నీటిని పొదుపుచేయ‌డానికి ఇప్ప‌టి నుంచే ఒక కార్య‌క్ర‌మాన్ని నిర్వహించ‌గ‌ల‌మా..? రైతుల‌కు మ‌ట్టి అవస‌రం ఉంటుంది. పొలంలో పంట పండించేందుకు ఆ మ‌ట్టి అవ‌స‌రం ఉంటుంది. ఈసారి మ‌నం చెరువులోంచి మ‌ట్టిని త‌వ్వి పండించేందుకు ఆ మ‌ట్టి అవ‌స‌రం ఉంటుంది. ఈసారి మ‌నం చెరువులోంచి మ‌ట్టిని త‌వ్వి తీసుకెళ్లి పొలంలో ఎందుకు వేయ‌కూడ‌దు? పొలం కూడా బాగా ప‌ండుతుంది. పొలానికి నీటిని నిల్వ‌ చేసుకొనే శ‌క్తి కూడా పెరుగుతుంది. అప్పుడ‌ప్పుడు సిమెంట్ సంచులలో, అప్పుడ‌ప్పుడు ఎరువుల ఖాళీ సంచులలో రాళ్లు, మ‌ట్టి నింపి- నీళ్లు వృథాగా పోయే మార్గాల్లో వాటిని అడ్డు పెట్టి ఆ నీరు పోకుండా చేయ‌వ‌చ్చు. ఐదు రోజులు నీరు, ఏడు రోజులు నీరు అంతా నిలచి ఉంటే.. అది భూమిలోకి ఇంకిపోతుంది. దాంతో భూమి లోని నీటిమ‌ట్టం పైకి వ‌స్తుంది. మ‌న బావుల్లోకి నీరు చేరుతుంది. ఎంత‌ నీటిని ఆప‌గ‌లిగితే, అంత నీటిని ఆపి ఉంచాలి. వ‌ర్ష‌పు నీరు, గ్రామ‌పు నీరు గ్రామంలోనే ఉంటుంది. ఇలా మ‌నం ఒక సంక‌ల్పం చేసి, ఏదో ఒక‌టి చేస్తే.. సామాజిక ప్ర‌య‌త్నం ద్వారా అంతా సంభ‌వ‌మే. ఈనాడు నీటికి ఎంతో క‌ష్టంగా ఉంది. అడుగంటిపోయిన ప‌రిస్థితి. కానీ మ‌న‌ వ‌ద్ద నెల‌న్న‌ర రోజులు స‌మ‌యం ఉంది.\nనేనైతే ఎప్పుడూ చెబుతుంటాను.. మ‌నం ఎప్పుడైనా మ‌హాత్మా గాంధీ జ‌న్మ‌ స్థ‌ల‌మైన పోర‌బంద‌ర్ కు వెళితే, అక్క‌డ మనం చూసే అనేక ప్ర‌దేశాలలో.. వాన నీటిని దాచి ఉంచడానికి భూమి లోపలి భాగంలో తవ్విన గుంటలను.. కూడా చూడవచ్చు; రమారమి 200 ఏళ్ల‌ క్రిత‌ం నిర్మించారు వీటిని- వాన నీటిని నిల్వ చేయడానికి. ఈ గుంటలలో సేకరించిన నీరు ఎంత పరిశుభ్రంగా ఉండేదో.\nశ్రీ కుమార్ కృష్ణ అనే ఆయ‌న MyGovలో రాశారు.. ఒక‌ రక‌మైన కుతూహ‌లాన్ని కూడా వ్య‌క్తం చేశారు; ఆయ‌నంటారు.. మ‌న జీవిత‌ కాలంలో గంగాన‌ది ప్ర‌క్షాళ‌న కార్య‌క్ర‌మం సంవ‌త్స‌రాల నుంచి న‌డుస్తోంది. ఎన్నో ప్ర‌భుత్వాలు వ‌చ్చాయి. ఇంచుమించుగా 30 సంవ‌త్స‌రాల నుంచి ఆ ప‌ని సాగుతోంది. ఎన్నో ప్ర‌భుత్వాలు వ‌చ్చాయి. ఎన్నో ప్రణాళిక‌లు రూపొందించారు. ఎంతో ఖ‌ర్చు కూడా అయింది. అందువ‌ల్ల సోద‌రుడు కుమార్‌ కృష్ణ వంటి దేశంలోని కోట్ల‌ మంది ప్ర‌జ‌ల్లో ఈ ప్ర‌శ్న త‌లెత్త‌డం చాలా స‌హ‌జం. ఎవ‌రైతే ఆధ్యాత్మిక స్థితిలో ఉంటారో వారికి గంగా న‌ది మోక్ష‌దాయిని. నేను ఈ ఆధ్యాత్మిక స‌త్యాన్ని ఆమోదిస్తాను. కానీ దీని కంటే ముఖ్యంగా నాక‌నిపిస్తుంది ఏంటంటే – గంగా న‌ది జీవ‌న‌దాయిని అని. గంగాన‌ది నుంచి మ‌న‌కు అనుదినం భోజ‌నం ల‌భిస్తుంది. గంగ నుంచి మ‌న‌కు రోజువారీ ప‌ని దొరుకుతుంది. గంగాన‌ది నుంచి మ‌న‌కు బ‌త‌క‌డానికి ఒక కొత్త శ‌క్తి ల‌భిస్తుంది. గంగా న‌ది ప్ర‌వ‌హిస్తూ ఉంటే దేశ ఆర్థిక గ‌తిశీల‌త‌కు కూడా ఒక కొత్త దిక్సూచి ల‌భిస్తుంది. ఒక భ‌గీర‌థుడు మ‌న‌కు గంగ‌ను తెచ్చిపెట్టాడు. కానీ దీనిని కాపాడుకోవ‌డానికి కోట్లాది భ‌గీర‌థుల అవ‌స‌రం ఉంది. ప్ర‌జ‌ల భాగ‌స్వామ్యం లేకుండా ఈ ప‌నిలో మ‌నం ఏనాటికీ స‌ఫ‌లం కాలేము. అందువ‌ల్ల ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రికీ శుభ్ర‌త కోసం, స్వ‌చ్ఛ‌త కోసం మార్పు తీసుకొచ్చే ఒక దూత‌గా మార‌వ‌ల‌సి ఉంటుంది. మ‌ళ్లీమ‌ళ్లీ ఇదే విష‌యాన్ని చెప్పాలి, చ‌ర్చించాలి. ప్ర‌భుత్వం త‌ర‌ఫు నుంచి అనేక ప్ర‌య‌త్నాలు జ‌రుగుతున్నాయి. గంగా తీరం వెంబ‌డి ఉన్న రాష్ట్రాల‌న్నింటి నుంచి పూర్తి స‌హ‌కారం తీసుకునేందుకు కూడా ప్ర‌య‌త్నం జ‌రుగుతోంది. ఇందులో సామాజిక‌ సంస్థలకు, స్వ‌చ్ఛంద సంస్థ‌ల‌కు కూడా పాత్ర క‌ల్పిస్తున్నాం. ఉప‌రిత‌ల ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త‌, పారిశ్రామిక కాలుష్యాన్ని ఆపేందుకు అనేక చ‌ర్య‌లు తీసుకుంటున్నాం. ప్ర‌తి రోజూ గంగా న‌దిలోకి కాల్వ‌ల ద్వారా పెద్ద మొత్తంలో చెత్తాచెదారం వ‌చ్చి చేరుతుంది. ఇటువంటి చెత్త‌ను శుభ్రం చేసేందుకు వార‌ణాసి, అల‌హాబాద్‌, కాన్పూర్‌, పట్నా మొద‌లైన చోట్ల ఉప‌రిత‌లం మీద తేలుతుండే చెత్త‌ను తీసివేసే ప‌ని జ‌రుగుతోంది. అన్ని స్థానిక సంస్థ‌ల‌కు ఈ విష‌యాన్ని వివ‌రించి, ఎక్క‌డిక‌క్క‌డ చెత్త‌ను శుభ్రం చేయ‌వ‌ల‌సిందిగా కోర‌డం జ‌రిగింది. ఎక్క‌డైతే ఈ ప‌రిశుభ్ర‌త కార్య‌క్ర‌మం జ‌రుగుతుందో, అక్క‌డ రోజుకు ‌3 ట‌న్నుల నుంచి 11 ట‌న్నుల వ‌ర‌కు చెత్త వెలికి వ‌స్తోంద‌ని తెలిసింది. అంటే ఆ మేర‌కు మురికిని వ్యాపించ‌కుండా ఆప‌గ‌లిగిన‌ట్లే క‌దా. రానున్న రోజులలో మ‌రిన్నిచోట్ల ట్రాష్ స్కిమ్మర్లు పెట్టించే ఆలోచ‌న ఉంది. ఇందువ‌ల్ల క‌లిగే లాభం గంగ, య‌మున న‌దుల ఒడ్డున ఉండే వారికి త‌క్ష‌ణ‌మే అనుభవంలోకి వ‌స్తుంది.\nపారిశ్రామిక కాలుష్యం మీద నియంత్ర‌ణ కోసం కాగితం, చ‌క్కెర ప‌రిశ్ర‌మ‌ల‌తో క‌లసి ఒక కార్యాచ‌ర‌ణ ప్ర‌ణాళిక‌ను సిద్ధం చేశాం. కొన్నిచోట్ల అది ప్రారంభం కూడా అయ్యింది. దీని ద్వారా కూడా మంచి ఫ‌లితాలు వ‌స్తాయ‌ని నాకు అనిపిస్తోంది. ఉత్త‌రాఖండ్‌, ఉత్త‌ర‌ ప్ర‌దేశ్‌ల‌లో డిస్టిల్ల‌రీల నుంచి వ‌చ్చే వ్య‌ర్థ ప‌దార్థాల‌ను పూర్తిగా నియంత్రించ‌గ‌లిగామ‌ని కొంద‌రు అధికారులు నాకు చెప్పారు. కాగితం ప‌రిశ్ర‌మ నుంచి వ‌చ్చే కాలుష్యం కూడా దాదాపు ఆగిపోయిన‌ట్లు. మ‌నంద‌రం స‌రైన దిశ‌లో ముందుకు వెళ్తున్నామ‌ని, ఒక జాగృతి క‌లిగింద‌ని దీనివల్ల తెలుస్తోంది. కేవ‌లం గంగా న‌ది ఒడ్డున నివ‌సించేవారే కాదు.. సుదూరంగా ద‌క్షిణ ప్రాంతాల్లోని వారు కూడా అడుగుతుంటారు గంగాన‌ది ప్ర‌క్షాళ‌న జ‌రుగుతుంది క‌దా ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి గారు అని. ఈ జ‌న‌ సామాన్యంలో ఉన్న విశ్వాస‌మే, న‌మ్మ‌క‌మే గంగా న‌ది ప్ర‌క్షాళ‌న‌లో మ‌న‌కు స‌త్ఫ‌లితాలు తెచ్చిపెడుతుంద‌ని నేను భావిస్తున్నాను. గంగా ప్ర‌క్షాళ‌న కార్య‌క్ర‌మం కోసం ప్ర‌జ‌లు విరాళాలు కూడా ఇస్తున్నారు. అలాగ ఈ ప్రయత్నం ఎంతో శ్రద్ధగా న‌డుస్తోంది.\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌ వాసులారా.. ఈరోజు ఏప్రిల్ 24. భార‌త‌దేశంలో ఈరోజును పంచాయ‌తీ రాజ్ దినంగా జ‌రుపుకొంటున్నాం. దేశంలో పంచాయ‌తీ రాజ్ వ్య‌వ‌స్థ ఇదే రోజు అమలులోకి వచ్చింది. పంచాయతీ రాజ్ వ్యవస్థ క్రమంగా యావత్తు దేశానికి విస్తరించింది. ఇంకా ఇది మ‌న ప్ర‌జాస్వామిక వ్యవ‌స్థలో ఒక ముఖ్యమైన భాగంగా మారి, విజ‌య‌వంతంగా ప‌ని చేస్తోంది కూడాను.\nఏప్రిల్ 14న బాబాసాహెబ్ అంబేడ్కర్ 125వ జ‌యంతిని మ‌నం జ‌రుపుకొన్నాం. ఈ రోజు 24 ఏప్రిల్ – పంచాయ‌తీ రాజ్ దినం జ‌రుపుకొంటున్నాం. ఇదెంత శుభ‌ప‌రిణామం అంటే, భార‌త రాజ్యాంగం ఇచ్చిన మ‌హాపురుషుని జ‌న్మ‌దినం మొద‌లు.. 24వ తారీఖు రాజ్యాంగంలో అత్యంత ప‌టిష్ట‌మైన భాగం. మ‌న ప‌ల్లెలు.. రెంటినీ క‌లిపే ప్రేర‌ణ. అందుకే రాష్ట్ర ప్ర‌భుత్వాల‌తో క‌లసి కేంద్ర‌ ప్ర‌భుత్వం ఏప్రిల్ 14 నుంచి 24 వ‌ర‌కు ప‌ది రోజుల‌ పాటు ‘గ్రామ ఉద‌య్ సే భార‌త్ ఉద‌య్’ అవ‌గాహ‌నా కార్య‌క్ర‌మాన్ని తీసుకొంది.\nబాబాసాహెబ్ అంబేడ్కర్ జ‌యంతి నాడు బాబాసాహెబ్ జ‌న్మ‌స్థానం ‘మ‌హు’ కు వెళ్లే అవ‌కాశం నాకు ద‌క్క‌డం నా అదృష్టం. ఆ ప‌విత్ర భూమికి న‌మ‌స్క‌రించే అవ‌కాశం ద‌క్కింది. ఇంకా ఈరోజు 24వ తారీఖున ఎక్క‌డైతే గిరిజ‌న సోద‌ర సోద‌రీమ‌ణులు ఎక్కువ‌గా నివ‌సిస్తున్నారో.. ఆ జార్ఖండ్ రాష్ట్రానికి వెళ్లి పంచాయ‌తీరాజ్ దినోత్స‌వాన్ని జ‌రుపుకోబోతున్నాం. మ‌ధ్యాహ్నం 3 గంట‌ల‌కు మ‌ళ్లీ ఓసారి పంచాయ‌తీరాజ్ దినోత్స‌వం సంద‌ర్భంగా దేశంలో పంచాయ‌తీల‌న్నింటితో మాట్లాడ‌బోతున్నాను. ఈ కార్య‌క్ర‌మం చాలా పెద్ద అవ‌గాహ‌న‌ను క‌ల్పించే ప‌నిచేసింది. హిందుస్థాన్ మూల‌మూల‌లా ఉన్న గ్రామ‌స్థాయిలో ప్ర‌జాస్వామ్య వ్య‌వ‌స్థ‌ను ప‌టిష్టం చేయ‌డం ఎలా..? గ్రామాలు త‌మ అభివృద్ధికి కావల‌సిన ప‌థ‌కాలు స్వ‌యంగా తామే ఎలా రూపొందించుకోవాలి… అనే అవ‌గాహ‌న ఇచ్చింది. మౌలిక స‌దుపాయాల‌కు ప్రాధాన్య‌త ఉన్న‌ట్లే సామాజిక మౌలిక స‌దుపాయాల‌కూ ప్రాధాన్య‌త ఉండాలి. గ్రామంలో పాఠ‌శాల నుంచి డ్రాప‌వుట్లు ఉండ‌కూడ‌దు. ‘బేటీ బ‌చావో – బేటీ ప‌ఢావో’ కార్య‌క్ర‌మం విజ‌య‌వంతంగా న‌డ‌వాలి. ఆడ‌ పిల్ల జ‌న్మ‌దినం గ్రామ‌మంత‌టికీ మ‌హోత్స‌వం కావాలి. ఇలాంటివి ఎన్నో ప‌థ‌కాలు. కొన్ని గ్రామాల్లో అయితే ఆహారం విరాళంగా ఇచ్చే కార్య‌క్ర‌మాలు కూడా జ‌రిగాయి. దేశంలోని ఇన్ని గ్రామాలలో ఇన్ని ర‌కాల కార్య‌క్ర‌మాలు ప‌ది రోజుల పాటు జ‌ర‌గ‌డం చాలా అరుదైన‌ది. ఈ సంద‌ర్భంగా రాష్ట్ర ప్ర‌భుత్వాలు, గ్రామ స‌ర్పంచులంద‌రికీ హార్దిక అభినంద‌న‌లు చెబుతున్నాను. మౌలిక ప‌ద్ధ‌తుల్లో కొత్త‌ద‌నం తెచ్చారు. గ్రామ మంచి కోసం, గ్రామాభివృద్ధి కోసం, ప్ర‌జాస్వామ్య ప‌టిష్ట‌త కోసం ఎన్నో ప‌నులు ఈ ఒక సంద‌ర్భంగా మార్చేశారు. గ్రామాల‌లో ఏ చైత‌న్య‌మైతే వ‌చ్చిందో.. అదే భార‌త ప్ర‌గ‌తికి హామీగా ఉంటుంది. భార‌త ప్ర‌గ‌తికి ఆధారం గ్రామాల ప్ర‌గ‌తే. అందుకే మ‌న‌మంతా గ్రామ ప్ర‌గ‌తిని బ‌లోపేతం చేస్తూ ఉంటే ఆశించిన ప‌రిణామాన్ని పొంది తీరుతాం.\nముంబై నుంచి శ‌ర్మిలా ధార్‌పురే – ఆమె ఫోన్ ద్వారా త‌న ఆందోళ‌న వ్య‌క్తం చేశారు.. (ఆమె మాటలు..)\n”ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి గారు.. నమ‌స్కారం. నేను ముంబై నుంచి శ‌ర్మిలా ధార్‌పురేను మాట్లాడుతున్నాను. మీకు పాఠ‌శాల‌, క‌ళాశాల విద్య గురించిన ప్ర‌శ్న ఇది. విద్యారంగంలో గ‌త చాలా ఏళ్లుగా ప్ర‌క్షాళ‌న‌కు అవ‌స‌రం ఏర్ప‌డింది. పాఠ‌శాల‌లు గానీ, క‌ళాశాల‌లు గానీ త‌గిన‌న్ని లేక‌పోవ‌డం, లేదా ఇంకా విద్య‌ నాణ్య‌త లేక‌పోవ‌డం.. ఎలా ఉందంటే.. పిల్ల‌లు విద్య‌ను పూర్తిచేస్తూనే ఉన్నారు. కానీ, చాలా సార్లు వారికి మౌలిక అంశాల గురించి కూడా తెలియ‌డం లేదు. దీని వ‌ల్ల ప్ర‌పంచ పోటీలో మ‌న పిల్ల‌లు వెనుక‌బ‌డిపోతారు. దీని గురించి మీ ఆలోచ‌న ఏమిటి.. ఈ రంగంలో ఏ ర‌కంగా దిద్దుబాటు తీసుకురావాల‌నుకుంటున్నారు..?\nదీని గురించి ద‌య‌చేసి మాకు చెప్పండి” అని.\nశర్మిలాజీ, మీ ఆందోళ‌న ఎంతో స‌హ‌జ‌మైన‌ది. ఇప్పుడు ప్ర‌తి కుటుంబంలో త‌ల్లితండ్రుల‌కు ఒక‌వేళ ఏదైనా స్వ‌ప్నం ఉంటుందంటే, అది పిల్ల‌ల‌ను బాగా చ‌దివించ‌డ‌మే అవుతుంది. ఇల్లు వాకిలి, వాహ‌నం.. ఇవ‌న్నీ ఆ త‌రువాతే వ‌స్తాయి. భార‌తదేశం వంటి దేశంలో అయితే ఇదే ప్ర‌తి ఒక్క‌రి భావ‌న‌. ఇదే చాలా పెద్ద బ‌లం కూడా. పిల్ల‌ల‌ను చ‌దివించ‌డం.. అదీ బాగా చ‌దివించ‌డం, మంచి విద్య ల‌భించ‌డం గురించిన ఆందోళ‌న చెంద‌డం.. ఇది ఇంకా పెర‌గాలి. ఇంకా దాని గురించిన మ‌రింత అవ‌గాహ‌న రావాలి. ఇంకా నేనేమ‌నుకుంటానంటే – ఈ అవ‌గాహ‌న ఏ కుటుంబాల‌లో ఉంటుందో, దాని ప్ర‌భావం పాఠ‌శాల‌ల‌ పైన ప‌డుతుంది. ఉపాధ్యాయుల మీదా వ‌స్తుంది. నేను దేని కోసం స్కూలుకు వెళ్తున్నాను అని పిల్ల‌లు కూడా అప్ర‌మ‌త్త‌మ‌వుతారు. అందుకే త‌ల్లితండ్రులు, అలానే ఈ విష‌యం గురించి ఆలోచించే అంద‌రినీ, ముందుగా నేను కోరేది ఏమిటంటే- స్కూల్లో జ‌రిగే అన్ని అంశాల గురించి విస్తృతంగా పిల్ల‌ల‌తో మాట్లాడండి. ఏదైనా విష‌యం మీ దృష్టికి వ‌స్తే, స్వ‌యంగా బడికి వెళ్లి ఉపాధ్యాయుల‌తో మాట్లాడండి. ఈ నిఘా వ్య‌వ‌స్థ మ‌న విద్యా వ్య‌వ‌స్థ‌లో చాలా లోటుపాట్లను తగ్గించగలుగుతుంది. దీనిని సాధించుకోవడంలో ప్ర‌జ‌ల భాగ‌స్వామ్యం పాత్ర ఎంతగానో ఉంది.\nమ‌న దేశంలో ప్రతి ప్ర‌భుత్వం విద్యా రంగానికి ప్రాధాన్య‌త నిచ్చింది. కానీ ప్ర‌తి ప్ర‌భుత్వం – త‌నదైన ప‌ద్ధ‌తుల్లో కృషి చేసింది కూడా. చాలా స‌మ‌యం వ‌ర‌కు మ‌న దృష్టి విద్యావ్య‌వ‌స్థ‌ను నిల‌బెట్ట‌డం పైనే ఉంద‌న్న‌ది కూడా వాస్త‌వం. విద్యా వ్య‌వ‌స్థను విస్త‌రించ‌డం, స్కూళ్లు పెట్ట‌డం, క‌ళాశాల‌లు ఏర్పాటు చేయ‌డం, టీచ‌ర్ల‌ను భ‌ర్తీ చేయ‌డం, ఎక్కువ‌ మంది పిల్లలు పాఠ‌శాల‌ల‌కు వ‌చ్చేలా చేయ‌డం – అంటే ఒక ర‌కంగా విద్య‌ను న‌లు దిశ‌లా వ్యాపింజేసే ప్ర‌య‌త్నం జ‌రిగింది. అదే ప్రాధాన్య‌త‌గా ఉంది. అది అవ‌స‌రం కూడా. కానీ ఇప్పుడు విస్త‌ర‌ణ‌కు ఎంత ప్రాధాన్య‌ముందో, అంత‌కంటే ఎక్కువ ప్రాధాన్య‌త విద్యా రంగంలో దిద్దుబాటుకు ఏర్ప‌డింది. విస్త‌రించే పెద్ద‌ ప‌ని మ‌నం పూర్తిచేశాం. ఇప్పుడు మ‌నం నాణ్య‌మైన విద్య‌పై దృష్టి పెట్టి తీరాల్సిందే. సాక్ష‌ర‌తా అభియాన్ నుంచి మంచి విద్య‌ను మ‌న మౌలిక అవ‌స‌రంగా మార్చుకోవాల్సివుంది. ఇప్ప‌టివ‌ర‌కు లెక్కలు ‘ఔట్‌లే’ గా ఉంటుండేవి. ఇప్పుడు ఔట్‌క‌మ్ ఫ‌లితాల పైనే ద‌ష్టి సారించాల్సి వుంది. ఇప్ప‌టి వ‌ర‌కు స్కూలుకు ఎంత‌ మంది వ‌చ్చారు అన్న‌ దాని పైనే దృష్టి ఉండేది. ఇప్పుడు స్కూలింగ్ కంటే ఎక్కువగా నేర్చుకోవ‌డం (లెర్నింగ్‌)పై శ్రద్ధ తీసుకోవాలి. స్కూలులో చేర్చ‌డం.. చేర్చ‌డం. ఈ మంత్రం నిరంత‌రం జ‌పిస్తూ వ‌చ్చాం. కానీ ఇప్పుడు స్కూలులో చేరిన పిల్ల‌ల‌కు మంచి విద్య‌.. యోగ్య‌మైన విద్య‌.. దీనిపై మ‌న దృష్టి కేంద్రీకృతం కావాలి. ప్ర‌స్తుత ప్ర‌భుత్వ బ‌డ్జెటును మీరు చూశారు క‌దా. విద్య‌ను బ‌లోపేతం చేసే ప్ర‌య‌త్నం జ‌రుగుతోంది. మ‌నం ఇందులో చాలా దూరం ప్ర‌యాణించాల్సి ఉంద‌న్న‌ది వాస్త‌వ‌మే. కానీ మ‌నం.. 125 కోట్ల మంది దేశ‌ ప్ర‌జ‌లం.. నిర్ణ‌యించుకుంటే సుదూర ప్ర‌యాణం కూడా చేసేయ్య‌గ‌లం. కానీ శ‌ర్మిలాజీ మాట నిజ‌మే. ఆసాంతం దిద్దుబాటు తీసుకురావ‌డం అవ‌స‌రం.\nఈసారి బ‌డ్జెటులో మీరు చూసే ఉంటారు – మేం మూస‌ ప‌ద్ధ‌తికి భిన్నంగా ప‌ని చేశాం. ప‌ది ప్ర‌భుత్వ విశ్వ‌విద్యాల‌యాలు, ప‌ది ప్రైవేట్ విశ్వ‌విద్యాల‌యాలను ఈసారి బ‌డ్జెట్‌లో ప్ర‌భుత్వ బంధ‌నాల నుంచి విముక్తి చేసి మ‌రింత స‌వాళ్ల‌తో కూడిన మార్గం ద్వారా రావాల‌ని వాటికి చెప్పాం. మీరు అత్యుత్త‌మ విశ్వ‌విద్యాల‌యం కావ‌డానికి మీరేం చేస్తారో చెయ్య‌మ‌న్నాం. వాటికి స్వ‌తంత్ర ప్ర‌తిప‌త్తిని ఇచ్చేందుకు ఆ కార్య‌క్ర‌మాన్ని తీసుకొన్నాం. భార‌త విశ్వ‌విద్యాల‌యాలు కూడా విశ్వ పోటీని ఎదుర్కోగ‌ల‌వి కాగ‌ల‌వు, అలా అవ్వాలి కూడా. దీనితో పాటు విద్య‌కు ఎంత ప్రాధాన్య‌త ఉంటుందో.. అంతే ప్రాధాన్య‌త నైపుణ్యానికీ ఉంది. అలాగే విద్య‌లో సాంకేతిక ప‌రిజ్ఞానం చాలా పెద్ద భూమిక‌నే పోషిస్తుంది. దూర‌ విద్య‌, సాంకేతిక ప‌రిజ్ఞానం – ఇవి మ‌న విద్యావ్య‌వ‌స్థ‌ను స‌ర‌ళ‌త‌ర‌మూ చేస్తాయి. ఇంకా చాలా తొంద‌ర‌లోనే వాటి ఫ‌లితాలు క‌నిపిస్తాయ‌ని నా విశ్వాసం.\nచాలా రోజులుగా ఒక విష‌యం మీద ప్ర‌జ‌లు న‌న్ను అడుగుతూ వస్తున్నారు. కొంద‌రు నా వెబ్‌పోర్ట‌ల్ mygov.in మీద రాస్తూ ఉంటారు. ఇంకొంద‌రు నాకు NarendraModiApp మీద రాస్తూ ఉంటారు. అందులోనూ యువ‌తీ యువ‌కులు ఎక్కువగా రాస్తారు.\nసౌండ్ బైట్-\n”ప్ర‌ధాన‌ మంత్రి గారు, న‌మ‌స్కారం.. నేను మోనా క‌ర్ణ‌వాల్ ను మాట్లాడుతున్నాను బిజ్ నోర్ నుంచి. ఇప్ప‌టి త‌రంలో యువ‌జ‌నుల‌కు చ‌దువుకోవ‌డంతో పాటు.. క్రీడ‌ల‌కు కూడా చాలా ప్రాముఖ్య‌ం ఉంది. వారిలో టీం స్పిరిట్ భావ‌న కూడా ఉండాలి. అలాగే మంచి నాయ‌కుల‌య్యే గుణం కూడా ఉండాలి. అప్పుడే వారి వ్య‌క్తిత్వ వికాసం సాధ్యం అవుతుంది. దీన్ని నా అనుభ‌వంతో చెబుతున్నాను. ఎందుకంటే – స్వ‌యంగా నేను భార‌త్ స్కౌట్స్ అండ్ గైడ్స్‌లో ఉన్నాను . నా జీవితం మీద అది ఎంతో మంచి ప్ర‌భావాన్ని చూపించింది. యువ‌తీయవుకులను మీరు ఎక్కువ‌గా చైత‌న్య‌ప‌ర్చాల‌ని కోరుకుంటున్నాను. ప్ర‌భుత్వం కూడా ఎన్ సిసి , భార‌త్ స్కౌట్స్ అండ్ గైడ్స్‌ను ప్రోత్స‌హించాల‌ని కోరుకుంటున్నాను.”\nమీరు ఎన్ని సూచ‌న‌లు ఇస్తున్నారంటే, మీ అంద‌రితో మాట్లాడే ముందు.. వీళ్ల‌తో మాట్లాడాల‌నిపించింది. మీ అంద‌రి ఒత్తిడి, మీ అంద‌రి సూచ‌న‌లు, వీట‌న్నిటి ప‌రిణామం ఏమైందంటే ఎన్ సిసి, ఎన్ ఎస్ ఎస్, భారత్ స్కౌట్స్‌ అండ్ గైడ్స్‌, రెడ్‌ క్రాస్ ప్ర‌ముఖులు, నెహ్రూ యువ‌ కేంద్ర ముఖ్యులు ఉండేలా ఒక స‌మావేశాన్ని ఏర్పాటు చేశాను. ఇంత‌కు ముందు ఎప్పుడు స‌మావేశ‌మ‌య్యార‌ని అడిగితే, వాళ్లు ఏమ‌న్నారంటే – దేశ స్వాతంత్ర్యం వ‌చ్చాక ఇలాంటి స‌మావేశం జ‌ర‌గ‌డం ఇదే మొద‌టి సారి అని చెప్పారు. అందుకే ఈ ప‌నుల‌న్నింటి విష‌యంలో నాపై ఒత్తిడి తెచ్చిన యువ‌ మిత్రుల‌కు నేను ముందుగా అభినంద‌న‌లు చెబుతాను. వారి కార‌ణంగానే నేను స‌మావేశం పెట్టాను. అలా చేయ‌డం మంచికే జ‌రిగింద‌ని అనిపించింది. ఎంతో సమ‌న్వ‌యం అవ‌స‌రం క‌న్పించింది నాకు. వాళ్ల వాళ్ల ప‌ద్ధ‌తుల్లో చాలా చేస్తున్నారు. కానీ ఒక‌వేళ సామూహిక రంగంలో సంఘ‌టితంగా మ‌న విభిన్న ప‌ద్ధ‌తుల‌ను సంఘ‌టితం చేసి ప‌నిచేస్తే ఎంత‌ పెద్ద ఫ‌లితం చూడగ‌ల‌మో. దాని విస్తృతి ఎంతో ఎక్కువో. ఎన్ని కుటుంబాల‌ను అది స్పృశించ‌గ‌ల‌దో. దాని విస్తృతిని చూసిన త‌రువాత నాకు పెద్ద ప‌రిష్కార‌మే ల‌భించింది. దాని ఘ‌నత కూడా ఎక్కువే. ఏదో ఒక‌టి చెయ్యాలి. ఇంకా నేను స్వ‌యంగా ఎన్ సిసి కేడెట్‌గా ఉన్నాన‌న్న మాట వాస్త‌వం. అందుకే ఇలాంటి సంఘ‌టిత వ్య‌వ‌స్థల వ‌ల్ల ఒక కొత్త దృష్టికోణం దొరుకుతుంద‌ని నాకు తెలుసు. ప్రేర‌ణ ల‌భిస్తుంది; ఒక జాతీయ దృక్ప‌థం పెరుగుతుంది. నాకైతే ఆ లాభం చిన్న‌తనంలో ల‌భించ‌నే ల‌భించింది. ఈ సంస్థ‌లలో ఒక న‌వ‌జీవ‌ం నింపాల‌ని కూడా నేననుకుంటాను. కొత్త శ‌క్తిని నింపాలి. ఈసారి వారి ముందు ఏదో విష‌యాన్ని ఉంచాను. నేను చెప్పాను చూడండి. ఈ సీజ‌న్‌లో జ‌ల‌ సంర‌క్ష‌ణ పెద్ద ఎత్తున ఎందుకు చేయ‌కూడ‌దు..? మ‌నం కృషి చేసి ఎన్ని బ్లాకులు, ఎన్ని జిల్లాలలో బ‌హిరంగ మ‌ల‌ విస‌ర్జ‌నను మాన్పించ‌గ‌లం..? ఈ ప్ర‌దేశాల‌ను బ‌హిరంగ మ‌ల‌ విస‌ర్జ‌న ర‌హిత ప్ర‌దేశాలుగా చేయ‌గ‌ల‌మా..? దేశాన్ని ఏకం చేయ‌డానికి ఎలాంటి కార్య‌క్ర‌మాన్ని రూపొందించ‌గ‌లం. ఈ సంస్థ‌ల‌న్నింటికీ ఉమ్మ‌డి యువ‌ గీతాన్ని పెట్టుకోగ‌ల‌మా.. ఇలాంటి ఎన్నో చ‌ర్చ‌లు వారితో జ‌రిగాయి.\nఇవాళ, నేను మీకందరికీ ఒక విన్నపం చేస్తున్నాను. దయచేసి ఈ యువజన సంస్థలకు పక్కాగా ఉండే ఉపాయాలను సూచించండి. వారి పనితీరులోను, వారి కార్యక్రమాలలోను ఏదైనా ఒక కొత్తదనాన్ని మనం జత చేయాలా? మీరు నాకు నా NarendraModiApp మీద రాస్తే, నేను వాటిని సరైన చోటుకు పంపిస్తాను. ఇంకా ఈ స‌మావేశం అనంతరం వారు ఒక కొత్త వేగాన్ని అందుకోగలుగుతారని నేను భావిస్తున్నాను. ఇక, మీరు కూడా వారితో క‌లసి ప‌నిచేయాల‌ని కోరుకుంటారు.\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌ వాసులారా.. ఈ రోజు మ‌నందరినీ ఆలోచింప‌జేసే విష‌యం చెప్పాలి. దీనిని మ‌న‌ల్నంద‌రినీ పున‌రాలోచింప‌జేసే విష‌యంగా కూడా ప‌రిగ‌ణిస్తారు. మీరు చూసే ఉంటారు; దేశ రాజ‌కీయ స్థితిగ‌తులు ఎలాంటివంటే – గ‌త కొన్ని ఎన్నిక‌ల్లో ఈ విష‌యం గురించి చ‌ర్చ జ‌రుగుతూ ఉండేది. ఏ పార్టీ ఎన్ని గ్యాస్ సిలిండ‌ర్లు ఇస్తోంది. 12 సిలిండ‌ర్లా.. లేక 9 సిలిండ‌ర్లా.. అనేది ఎన్నిక‌ల్లో పెద్ద చ‌ర్చ‌నీయాంశం అయ్యేది. అలాగే మ‌ధ్య‌ త‌ర‌గ‌తి స‌మాజాన్ని ఎన్నిక‌ల దృష్టితో అందుకోవాలంటే గ్యాస్ సిలిండ‌ర్ పెద్ద అంశం అని రాజ‌కీయ పార్టీల‌కు అనిపిస్తూ ఉండేది. ఇంకో వైపు రాయితీలు త‌గ్గించాల‌ని ఆర్థిక శాస్త్ర‌వేత్త‌ల ఒత్తిడి ఉండేది. ఆ కార‌ణంగానే ఎన్నో క‌మిటీలు ఏర్పాట‌య్యాయి. ఆ కమిటీలకు వంట‌ గ్యాస్ రాయితీని త‌గ్గించ‌డంపైన పలు ప్రతిపాదనలు అందేవి. గ్యాస్ సబ్సిడీని తగ్గించాలనే అంశంపైన సలహాలు వచ్చేవి. ఈ క‌మిటీల పై కోట్లాది రూపాయ‌లు ఖ‌ర్చ‌య్యేది. కానీ విష‌యం ఎక్కడిది అక్క‌డే ఉండిపోయేది. ఇది ప్రతి ఒక్కరికీ అనుభ‌వంలోనిదే. ఎవ్వరూ దీనికి మించి ఆలోచించనే లేదు.\nఈ రోజు, ప్రియమైన నా దేశ వాసులారా, ఈ విషయంలో నా సొంత విషయాన్నే మీ ముందు ఉంచడానికి నాకు ఎంతో ఆనందంగా ఉంది. నేను మూడో మార్గాన్ని ఎంచుకొన్నాను. మూడో మార్గం ఏదంటే, ప్ర‌జలు, సామాన్య జనం మీద విశ్వాసాన్ని ఉంచ‌డం. కొన్ని సార్లు రాజ‌కీయ నాయ‌కులు త‌మ‌ మీద న‌మ్మ‌కం పెట్టుకోవ‌డం కంటే త‌మ ప్రజల పైన న‌మ్మ‌కం పెట్టుకోవాలి. మనం ప్రజలలో ప్రగాఢ నమ్మకాన్ని ఉంచాలి. నేను ఒకసారి అన్నాను కదా.. మీరు ఏడాదికి ఒక 1500- 2000 రూపాయ‌ల ఖ‌ర్చును భ‌రించ‌గ‌లిగే ప‌క్షంలో, మీ గ్యాస్ స‌బ్సిడీని ఎందుకు విడిచిపెట్ట‌రు? అని. ఇది పేద‌ కుటుంబాలకు ఉపయోగపడవచ్చు. నేను ఆ మాటలు య‌థాలాపంగా చెప్పినవే, అయినా.. ఈ విష‌యంలో నేను ఈరోజు స‌గ‌ర్వంగా చెప్ప‌గ‌లుగుతున్నాను. నా దేశ‌ వాసులు నా న‌మ్మ‌కాన్ని వ‌మ్ము చేయ‌లేదు. ఒక కోటి కుటుంబాలు స్వ‌చ్ఛందంగా త‌మ గ్యాస్ స‌బ్సిడీని స‌రెండ‌ర్ చేశాయి. ఈ కోటి కుటుంబాలు సంప‌న్న కుటుంబాలు కావు. ఒక రిటైర్ అయిన టీచ‌ర్‌, రిటైరైన గుమాస్తా, రైతు లేదా చిన్న దుకాణం న‌డుపుకొనే వారు.. ఇలా మ‌ధ్య‌ త‌ర‌గ‌తి వారు, దిగువ మ‌ధ్య‌ త‌ర‌గ‌తి వారు, వీరు త‌మ స‌బ్సిడీని విడిచిపెట్టారు. పైగా స‌బ్సిడీని వదులుకోవడం ఎంతో తేలిక కూడా. మొబైల్ ఫోన్‌లో యాప్ ద్వారా చేయ‌వ‌చ్చు. ఆన్‌లైన్ లో చేయ‌వ‌చ్చు. టెలిఫోన్ నంబరుకు మిస్ డ్ కాల్ ఇచ్చి కూడా స‌బ్సిడీని విడిచిపెట్ట‌వ‌చ్చు. ఇలా బోలెడు ప‌ద్ధ‌తులు ఉన్నాయి. కానీ ప‌రిశీలిస్తే తెలిసిన ఆస‌క్తిక‌ర‌మైన విష‌యం ఏమిటంటే – స‌బ్సిడీని వద్దనుకున్న కోటి కుటుంబాలలోను 80 శాతం కంటే ఎక్కువ‌ మంది పంపిణీదారు వ‌ద్ద‌కు వెళ్లి, వరుసలో నిల‌బ‌డి మరీ తాము స‌బ్సిడీని స‌రెండ‌ర్ చేయదల్చుకొన్నామ‌ంటూ రాత‌పూర్వ‌కంగా సమాచారమిచ్చారని అంచనా వేయడం జరిగింది.\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌ వాసులారా, ఇది చిన్న విష‌యం ఏమీ కాదు. ప్ర‌భుత్వం ఎప్పుడ‌న్నా ఒక ప‌న్నులో రాయితీ, లేదా మిన‌హాయింపు ఇస్తే వారం రోజుల పాటు టీవీలో, ప‌త్రిక‌లలో ప్ర‌భుత్వాన్ని మెచ్చుకుంటూ వార్త‌ల ప‌రంప‌ర వ‌స్తుంది. కానీ ఇది చూడండి. ఒక కోటి కుటుంబాలు స‌బ్సిడీని వ‌దులుకున్నాయి. మ‌న దేశంలో ఒక‌ విధంగా ఒక హ‌క్కుగా మారిన స‌బ్సిడీని ఈ కుటుంబాలు విడిచిపెట్టాయి.\nనేను ఆ కోటి కుటుంబాల వారికి శ‌త‌ స‌హ‌స్ర ప్ర‌ణామాలు చేస్తున్నాను.. వారిని అభినందిస్తున్నాను. ఎందుకంటే, వారు రాజ‌కీయ నాయ‌కులు కొత్తగా ఆలోచించేలా చేశారు. ఈ ఒక్క విష‌యం మ‌న దేశంలో ఆర్ధిక శాస్త్ర‌వేత్త‌లు కూడా భిన్నంగా ఆలోచించేలా చేసింది. ఇలా చేస్తే.. అలా జ‌రుగుతుంది. ఇటువంటి ప్ర‌య‌త్నంలో అటువంటి ఫ‌లితం వ‌స్తుంది అని ఆర్థిక స‌మీక‌ర‌ణాలు, లెక్క‌లు, గుణింతాలు వేసే ఆర్థిక నిపుణులు కూడా త‌మ ప‌రిధి దాటి ఆలోచించేలా చేసింది ఈ స‌బ్సిడీని విడిచిపెట్టే ప‌ర్వం. ఈ విష‌యంలో ఎప్పుడో ఒక‌ప్పుడు లోతుగా ఆలోచించాలి. ఒక కోటి కుటుంబాలు స‌బ్సిడీని వ‌దులుకొన్నందుకు బ‌దులుగా మరొక కోటి పేద కుటుంబాల‌కు గ్యాస్ సిలిండ‌ర్లు ల‌భించ‌డం. స‌బ్సిడీ వ‌ద‌లుకోవ‌డం వ‌ల్ల డ‌బ్బు మిగిలింది అన్న‌ది బ‌య‌టి నుంచి చూసే వారికి పెద్ద చెప్పుకోద‌గ్గ విష‌యం కాదు. కానీ ప్ర‌జల పైన విశ్వాసంతో ప‌నిచేస్తే, ఎంత పెద్ద ఫ‌లిత‌మైనా సాధించ‌గ‌ల‌మ‌న్న‌ది అసాధార‌ణ‌మైన పాఠం.\nరాజ‌కీయ శ్రేణులన్నింటికీ ప్రత్యేకంగా నాదొక విజ్ఞ‌ప్తి. ప్ర‌జ‌ల పైన న‌మ్మ‌కం ఉంచాల‌న్న విష‌యాన్ని క‌చ్చితంగా ఒక‌సారి ప్ర‌స్తావించండి. ఇలాంటి ఫ‌లితాలు మ‌న‌కి ల‌భిస్తాయి అని మీరు అస‌లు ఊహించి ఉండ‌రు. మ‌నం ఈ దిశ‌లోనే ముందుకు సాగాలి. నాకు ఇంకో విష‌యం ప‌దేప‌దే స్ఫుర‌ణ‌కు వ‌స్తుంటుంది. 3వ తరగతి, 4వ త‌ర‌గ‌తి ఉద్యోగార్థుల‌ను ఎందుకు ఇంట‌ర్వ్యూ చేయడం..? ప‌రీక్ష రాసి, మార్కుల‌ జాబితాను సమర్పిస్తున్న వ్యక్తిని మనం నమ్మాలి.\nకొన్ని సార్లు నాకు ఇంకొకటి అనిపిస్తుంది.. రైలు ప్ర‌యాణాలలో కొన్ని మార్గాలలో ఎవ‌రూ టికెట్ త‌నిఖీ చేసే వారు ఉండ‌ర‌ని ప్ర‌క‌టిద్దాం. దేశ ప్ర‌జ‌ల పైన భరోసా ఉంచుదాం. ఇలా ఎన్నో ర‌కాల ప్ర‌యోగాలు చేయ‌వ‌చ్చు. ఒక్క‌సారి అలాంటి న‌మ్మ‌కం పెట్టుకుంటే, తిరుగులేని ఫ‌లితాలు ల‌భిస్తాయి. స‌రే, ఇవి నా మ‌న‌సులో ఆలోచ‌న‌లు, వీటిని ప్ర‌భుత్వ నిబంధ‌న‌లుగా మార్చ‌లేం కదా. కానీ ఇటువంటి వాటికి వీలు ఉండే వాతావ‌ర‌ణాన్ని క‌ల్పించ‌వ‌చ్చు. ఈ సానుకూల వాతావ‌ర‌ణాన్ని రాజ‌కీయ నాయ‌కులు కాదు.. మ‌న దేశంలో కోటి కుటుంబాలే క‌ల్పించాయి.\nర‌వి అనే వ్యక్తి ఒకరు నాకు ఒక లేఖను రాశారు.. ”ప్ర‌తి రోజు శుభవార్తే.. అంటూ ఆయన ఇంకా ఇలా రాశారు.. దయచేసి ప్రతి రోజూ ఏద‌న్నా ఒక మంచి సంఘటనను గురించి పోస్ట్ చేయ‌మ‌ని మీ అధికారుల‌ను ఆదేశించండి అంటున్నారు ఆయ‌న‌. ప్ర‌తి వార్తాప‌త్రిక‌లోను, టీవీ ఛాన‌ల్ లోను బ్రేకింగ్ న్యూస్ అంటే అన్నీ దుర్వార్త‌లే ఉంటున్నాయి. 125 కోట్ల మంది జ‌నాభా ఉన్న ఈ దేశంలో మ‌న చుట్టుప‌క్క‌ల అస‌లు మంచి విష‌యమేదీ జ‌ర‌గ‌డమే లేదా..? ఈ ప‌రిస్థితిని మార్చండి” అని.\nర‌వి గారు తన కోపాన్ని వ్య‌క్తం చేశారు. కానీ, ఆయ‌న ఆగ్రహం నా మీద కాదు.. ఇప్పుడు నెలకొన్న ప‌రిస్థితుల మీద అని నేను అనుకుంటున్నాను. మీకు గుర్తుండే ఉంటుంది, మ‌న పూర్వ రాష్ట్ర‌ప‌తి డాక్ట‌ర్ ఎ.పి.జె. అబ్దుల్ క‌లామ్ ఎప్పుడు చెప్తుండే వారు- ”దయచేసి వార్తాప‌త్రిక మొద‌టి పేజీలో కేవ‌లం మంచి వార్త‌లే అచ్చు వేయాలి” అని. ఆయ‌న ఇదే సంగతిని ప్రతి సారి మళ్లీ మళ్లీ చెప్తుండే వారు.\nకొద్ది రోజుల క్రితం ఒక వార్తాప‌త్రిక నాకో ఉత్త‌రం రాసింది.. ”ప్ర‌తి సోమ‌వారం మేము ఎటువంటి చెడ్డ‌ వార్త‌లను కాకుండా కేవలం మంచి వార్తలను మాత్రమే ఇస్తాం అని నిర్ణయించుకొన్నాం’’ అనేది అందులోని సారాంశం. ఈ రోజులలో కొన్ని టి.వి. ఛానల్స్ మంచి వార్తల కోసం కొంత సమయాన్ని కేటాయిస్తున్నాయని నేను గమనించాను.\nసానుకూలమైన వార్త‌లకు అంతటా ఒక వాతావ‌ర‌ణం ఏర్ప‌డింద‌ని చెప్పడం సరైందే. మంచి వార్త‌లు, స‌రైన వార్త‌లు ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌కు అంద‌డం అవ‌స‌ర‌మ‌ని ప్రతి ఒక్కరికీ అనిపిస్తోంది. ఎంత గొప్ప వ్య‌క్తి అయినా.. ఎంత ఉత్త‌మోత్త‌మ‌మైన మాట మాట్లాడినా.. ఎంత అద్భుత‌మైన ప‌ద్ధ‌తిలో చెప్పినా.. ఆ మాట‌ల‌కు ఒక శుభ‌ వార్త కంటే ఎక్కువ శ‌క్తి, ప్ర‌భావం ఉంటాయ‌ని అన‌లేము. ఒక మంచి వార్త మ‌నల్ని మంచి ప‌ని చేసేలా ప్రేరేపించే శ‌క్తిని క‌లిగి ఉంటుంది.\nఅందువ‌ల్ల మ‌నం మంచికి బ‌లం చేకూరుస్తామో.. అక్క‌డ చెడుకు స‌హ‌జంగానే స్థానం లేకుండా పోతుంది. ఒక దీపం వెలిగిస్తే చీక‌టి తొలగిపోతుంది. తొలగి తీరుతుంది. మీకు తెలిసే ఉంటుంది. ప్ర‌భుత్వం transforming india అనే ఒక వెబ్‌సైట్ ను న‌డిపిస్తోంది. ఈ వెబ్‌సైట్‌లో అన్ని సానుకూల‌మైన వార్త‌లే ఉంటాయి. అంటే ప్రభుత్వం వైపు నుంచే కాదు.. ప్ర‌జ‌ల నుంచి కూడా మంచి వార్త‌లు, క‌థ‌నాలు అందులో ఉంటాయి. అంతే కాదు.. మీకు ఏదైనా మంచి విష‌యాలు తెలిస్తే మీరు కూడా మీకు సంబంధించిన మంచి వార్త‌లు పంప‌వ‌చ్చు.\nర‌వి గారు, మీరు ఎంతో మంచి సూచ‌న చేశారు; కానీ, ద‌య‌చేసి నా మీద అంత కోపం వద్దండి. ఏదైనా సకారాత్మకమైనది చేయడానికి, సకారాత్మకమైన మాటలు మాట్లాడడానికి, సకారాత్మకమైన విషయాలను వ్యాప్తి లోకి తీసుకు రావడానికి మనం కలసి పాటు పడవలసివుంది.\nమ‌న దేశంలో చెప్పుకోద‌గ్గ విశేష ఉత్స‌వం ‘కుంభ‌ మేళ‌’. కుంభ‌ మేళ ప‌ర్యాటక ప‌రంగా కూడా ఒక ఆక‌ర్ష‌ణ‌గా నిలుస్తోంది. ఇన్నిరోజుల పాటు కోట్లాది మంది ఒక న‌దీ తీరంలో చేరి, ప‌విత్ర స్నానాలు చేస్తార‌ని ప్ర‌పంచంలో చాలా త‌క్కువ మందికి తెలిసి ఉంటుంది. ప్ర‌శాంత‌మైన, శాంతిపూర్వ‌క‌మైన వాతావ‌ర‌ణంలో ఈ ఉత్స‌వం ముగియాలి. నిర్వ‌హ‌ణ దృష్ట్యా.. ఉత్స‌వ ఏర్పాట్ల దృష్ట్యా.. ప్ర‌జ‌ల భాగ‌స్వామ్యం దృష్ట్యా.. ఇటువంటి ఉత్స‌వాలు అతి భారీ స్థాయిలో కొత్త ప్ర‌మాణాలను నిర్దేశిస్తాయి, సాధిస్తాయి. గ‌త కొద్ది రోజులుగా చాలా మంది సింహ‌స్థ కుంభ్ మేళా ఫొటోలను అప్‌లోడ్ చేయడం నేను గ‌మ‌నించాను. కేంద్ర‌, రాష్ట్ర‌ ప్ర‌భుత్వాల ప‌ర్యాట‌క సంస్థ‌లు ఒక ఛాయాచిత్ర పోటీని నిర్వ‌హించాల‌ని నేను భావిస్తున్నాను. మంచి ఫొటోలు తీసి, అప్‌లోడ్ చేసేటట్లు ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌ను ప్రోత్స‌హించాలి. ఇటువంటి ఫొటోల‌తో ఒక్క‌సారి ఉత్తేజ‌క‌ర‌మైన వాతావ‌ర‌ణం, చైత‌న్యం ఏర్ప‌డి.. కుంభ‌ మేళాలో అడుగు అడుగునా ఎంత వైవిధ్యం నెల‌కొని ఉందో.. ఎంత అద్భుత‌మైన సంగ‌తులు జ‌రుగుతున్నాయో తెలుస్తుంది. ఇది త‌ప్ప‌నిస‌రిగా చేయాలి.\nఇటీవల మ‌ధ్య‌ ప్ర‌దేశ్ ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి నన్ను క‌లిశారు. మ‌నం స్వ‌చ్ఛ‌త ను గురించిన సందేశాలను ఇస్తున్నాం. కానీ, అది ఉన్న‌ చోట పాటించ‌డ‌మే కాదు.. మ‌నం ఎక్క‌డ‌కు వెళితే అక్క‌డ‌కు ఆ సందేశాన్ని మోసుకుపోవాల‌ని, ప్ర‌జ‌ల‌కు చెప్పాలి అని అన్నారు ఆయ‌న‌. కుంభ‌ మేళ మ‌త‌ప‌ర‌మైన‌, ఆధ్యాత్మికమైన ఉత్స‌వ‌మే అయినప్ప‌టికీ – మ‌నం దానిని ఒక సామాజిక సంద‌ర్భంగా కూడా భావించాలి. కొన్ని ప‌ద్ధ‌తులు పాటించే సంద‌ర్భంగా మార్చుకోవాలి. ఈ ఉత్స‌వాల్లో మ‌నం మంచి సంక‌ల్పాలు, మంచి అల‌వాట్లు సొంతం చేసుకుని వాటిని ఆ త‌రువాత గ్రామ‌ గ్రామాలలో ప్ర‌చారం చేసే బాధ్య‌తను వ‌హించ‌వ‌చ్చు. నీరు అంటే ప్రేమ ఎలా పెర‌గాలి.. జ‌లం ప‌ట్ల విశ్వాసం ఎలా పెర‌గాలి.. నీటి సేక‌ర‌ణ‌, నిల్వ ఎలా జ‌ర‌పాలి.. ఎలా వినియోగించుకోవాల‌నే సంగ‌తుల‌ను మ‌నం కుంభ‌ మేళ ద్వారా ఈ మేళా సంద‌ర్భంగా నేర్చుకోవ‌చ్చు. ఈ కుంభ‌ మేళా అనే సంద‌ర్భాన్ని ఈ ల‌క్ష్యంతో ఎలా ఉప‌యోగించుకోవ‌చ్చో ఆలోచించాలి.\nప్రియ‌మైన నా దేశ‌ వాసులారా… పంచాయ‌తీ రాజ్ దినం వంటి ముఖ్యమైన సంద‌ర్భంలో నేను ఈ రోజు సాయంత్రం మీ అందరితోను తప్పక సమావేశమవుతాను. మీ అంద‌రికీ ఇవే నా హృద‌య‌పూర్వ‌క‌ ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు. ఎప్ప‌టి లాగే, మీ మ‌న‌సులోని ఆలోచనలకు, నా మ‌న‌సులోని ఆలోచనలకు మధ్య ఏర్పడిన విడదీయరాని బంధం నాకు అంతులేని ఆనందాన్ని ఇస్తోంది.\nమీకివే నా ధ‌న్య‌వాదాలు.\n"

        "article": "\nMy dear fellow citizens, Namaskar!\nIt’s summer. Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays. Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit. Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice. But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.\nIt is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat. On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected. Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked. As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity. Worse, because of this cycle that has been going on for years, the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced. To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts. But that’s not all. I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation. Awareness is now seen in many villages. Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water. Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.\nI was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue. One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water. At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern. They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana. It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so. What a big collective decision this must have been? If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be. But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers. When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it. Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water. Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face. I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages. I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.\nI was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds. They have already created 27 farm ponds. Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level. Whenever water was required for crops, farmers had access to it. This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent. Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing. World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth. It certainly contributes to better health.\nWhen the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world. There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy. But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise. Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise. There are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn’t get our attention. The good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice. If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.\nIt is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over. Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come. There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy. At the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge. Can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself? Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops. This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields? If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase. Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches? If we were to stop water from draining out for five days, for seven days, it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up. There would be sufficient water in our water-wells. Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible. The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively. Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.\nI have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water. Water collected in these tanks remained pure.\nMr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”. His concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction. Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results. For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts. For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them. I too accept this importance of Ganga. But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life. We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives. The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country. Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths. The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people. So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness. We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing. There are many efforts being made by the government. We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows. We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort. We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution. Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains. At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it. All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river. I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day. So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river. In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.\nTo monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent. I feel it will yield good results. I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better. Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge. The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end. All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased. I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?” This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this. Thus this effort is being made quite meticulously.\nMy dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April. This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India. On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country. Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.\nWe celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day. This was such a fortunate coincidence. From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution. It inspired linking these two dates. For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign – “From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday” – From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.\nIt was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place. And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas. At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country. This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness. How can the democratic institutions at the village level, in every corner of India, be strengthened? How can the villages become self-reliant? How can villages plan programmes for their own development? There should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure. There should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan) should be successfully carried out. The birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way. There should be some plans to do that. In some villages people organised food donation on this occasion. It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India. I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads. They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy. The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India. The foundation for the progress of India is the rise of its villages; so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.\nSharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call. Sound byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar. I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai. I have a question for you about the school and college education. For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector. Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking. It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world. What are your views? How do you wish to bring about reforms?”\nSharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine. Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education. A house, a car – all that comes later. And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force. To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about. I believe that when there is awareness in the family, it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well. The child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school. So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school. And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself. Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system. People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.\nEvery Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way. It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children. So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education. This was necessary. But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education. We have already done a lot towards expanding education. Now we will have to focus on quality education. We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education. Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education. The time has come to focus on the outcome of it. Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school. From now onward, more than schooling, we will have to lay stress on learning. Till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment! But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools. You must have seen the Budget of the present government. An effort is being made to provide quality education. But it is true we still have a long way to go. If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance. Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.\nYou must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional. In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own. We have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities. We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand. Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should. Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill. Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education. Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler. I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.\nSince a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic. Some have written on my web portal mygov.in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp. It’s mostly the youth who write to me.\nSound Byte-\n“Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore. For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance. They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development. I state this from my own experience because I have served in the Bharat Scouts and Guides and this had a very good impact upon my life. I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.”\nYou people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people. It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra. I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this. So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting. I felt glad that I met them. I felt the need for greater coordination. They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results. They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families. I saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm, they had the resolve to do something. It’s true that I myself have been a cadet in the NCC and so I know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations. Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective. I did get the benefit of that in my childhood. I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations. This time I put some issues before them. I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation. We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts. What kind of programmes can we make to unite our country? Can we have a common youth song for all these organizations? We spoke on many issues.\nToday, I appeal to you all as well. Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations. Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes? If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place. After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum. Now even you will wish to join one of them.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think. I view it also as something that is going to shake us all. You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders. And each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society, then gas cylinder was a major issue. On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders. For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy. Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees. But the matter would remain at a standstill. This has been everybody’s experience. No one ever thought beyond this.\nToday, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this. I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses. At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves. We should have implicit faith in the people. I had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500-2000 rupees per year, then why don’t you give up your subsidy on gas? This could be of use to poor households. I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. These one crore are not wealthy families. Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy. Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it. They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone. There were many options. But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter. If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers. Here, these one crore families have given up their subsidy. And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect. A thing like that they have chosen to give up.\nI would like to salute those one crore families. I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently. Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom. At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking. One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy. Externally, it appears just an incident But, its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people, it leads to most handsome achievements.\nI would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people. That will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined. We should move in this direction. I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews. We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.\nSometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker. Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India. We can undertake several such experiments. Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results. Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts. We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere. This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.\nA person called Ravi has written to me – “Good News Everyday — he writes — please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day. Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every ‘breaking news’. Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people? Please change this situation.”\nRavi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions. You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, used to always say, “Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper”. He used to continuously repeat that.\nSome days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news. These days I have noticed that some T.V. channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news.\nSo it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news. And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news. It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that. Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.\nIt is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things. If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled. You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india. On this you get news of positive happenings, not just of the government but also of the people around. This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing that’s happened to you. You can contribute to the site.\nRaviji you have given a good suggestion, but please don’t get angry with me. We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.\nThere is one great speciality of our country — the Kumbh Mela. The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well. Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival. The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul. These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and people’s participation, set new and high standards. I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela. I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion. People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them. What an atmosphere that would create. People will also come to know of the myriad and different activities going on in every corner of the Kumbh Mela. This can surely be done.\nIt’s true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness. It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them. I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion. We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values. It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages. We should use each Kumbh Mela to make people aware of how we can increase our value for water, our faith in water; how we can spread the message of water conservation. We should do this.\nMy dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today. My heartiest thanks to you all. As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.\nMany thanks!\n"
