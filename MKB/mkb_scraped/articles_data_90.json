        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

        "article": "\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आप सब को बहुत-बहुत नमस्कार! आज दुनिया भर में ईसाई समुदाय के लोग Easter मना रहे हैं। मैं सभी लोगों को Easter की ढ़ेरों शुभकामनायें देता हूँ।\nमेरे युवा दोस्तो, आप सब एक तरफ़ Exam में busy होंगे। कुछ लोगों की exam पूरी हो गयी होगी। और कुछ लोगों के लिए इसलिए भी कसौटी होगी कि एक तरफ़ exam और दूसरी तरफ़ T-20 Cricket World Cup. आज भी शायद आप भारत और Australia के match का इंतज़ार करते होंगे। पिछले दिनों भारत ने पाकिस्तान और बांग्लादेश के खिलाफ़ दो बेहतरीन match जीते हैं। एक बढ़िया सा momentum नज़र आ रहा है। आज जब Australia और भारत खेलने वाले हैं, मैं दोनों टीमों के players को अपनी शुभकामनायें देता हूँ।\n65 प्रतिशत जनसँख्या नौजवान हो और खेलों की दुनिया में हम खो गए हों! ये तो बात कुछ बनती नहीं है। समय है, खेलों में एक नई क्रांति का दौर का। और हम देख रहे हैं कि भारत में cricket की तरह अब Football, Hockey, Tennis, Kabaddi एक mood बनता जा रहा है। मैं आज नौजवानों को एक और खुशखबरी के साथ, कुछ अपेक्षायें भी बताना चाहता हूँ। आपको शायद इस बात का तो पता चल गया होगा कि अगले वर्ष 2017 में भारत FIFA Under – 17 विश्वकप की मेज़बानी करने जा रहा है। विश्व की 24 टीमें भारत में खेलने के लिए आ रही हैं। 1951, 1962 Asian Games में भारत ने Gold Medal जीता था और 1956 Olympic Games में भारत चौथे स्थान पर रहा था। लेकिन दुर्भाग्य से पिछले कुछ दशकों में हम निचली पायरी पर ही चलते गए, पीछे ही हटते गए, गिरते ही गए, गिरते ही गए। आज तो FIFA में हमारा ranking इतना नीचे है कि मेरी बोलने की हिम्मत भी नहीं हो रही है। और दूसरी तरफ़ मैं देख रहा हूँ कि इन दिनों भारत में युवाओं की Football में रूचि बढ़ रही है। EPL हो, Spanish League हो या Indian Super League के match हो। भारत का युवा उसके विषय में जानकारी पाने के लिए, TV पर देखने के लिए समय निकालता है। कहने का तात्पर्य यह है कि रूचि तो बढ़ रही है। लेकिन इतना बड़ा अवसर जब भारत में आ रहा है, तो हम सिर्फ़ मेज़बान बन कर के अपनी जिम्मेवारी पूरी करेंगे? इस पूरा वर्ष एक Football, Football, Football का माहौल बना दें। स्कूलों में, कॉलेजों में, हिन्दुस्तान के हर कोने पर हमारे नौजवान, हमारे स्कूलों के बालक पसीने से तर-ब-तर हों। चारो तरफ़ Football खेला जाता हो। ये अगर करेंगे तो फिर तो मेज़बानी का मज़ा आएगा और इसीलिए हम सब की कोशिश होनी चाहिये कि हम Football को गाँव-गाँव, गली-गली कैसे पहुँचाएं। 2017 FIFA Under – 17 विश्वकप एक ऐसा अवसर है इस एक साल के भीतर-भीतर हम चारों तरफ़ नौजवानों के अन्दर Football के लिए एक नया जोम भर दे, एक नया जुत्साह भर दे। इस मेज़बानी का एक फ़ायदा तो है ही है कि हमारे यहाँ Infrastructure तैयार होगा। खेल के लिए जो आवश्यक सुविधाएँ हैं उस पर ध्यान जाएगा। मुझे तो इसका आनंद तब मिलेगा जब हम हर नौजवान को Football के साथ जोड़ेंगें।\nदोस्तो, मैं आप से एक अपेक्षा करता हूँ। 2017 की ये मेज़बानी, ये अवसर कैसा हो, साल भर का हमारा Football में momentum लाने के लिए कैसे-कैसे कार्यक्रम हो, प्रचार कैसे हो, व्यवस्थाओं में सुधार कैसे हो, FIFA Under – 17 विश्वकप के माध्यम से भारत के नौजवानों में खेल के प्रति रूचि कैसे बढ़े, सरकारों में, शैक्षिक संस्थाओं में, अन्य सामाजिक संगठनों में, खेल के साथ जुड़ने की स्पर्धा कैसे खड़ी हो? Cricket में हम सभी देख पा रहे हैं, लेकिन यही चीज़ और खेलों में भी लानी है। Football एक अवसर है। क्या आप मुझे अपने सुझाव दे सकते हैं? वैश्विक स्तर पर भारत का branding करने के लिए एक बहुत बड़ा अवसर मैं मानता हूँ। भारत की युवा शक्ति की पहचान कराने का अवसर मानता हूँ। Match के दरमियाँ क्या पाया, क्या खोया उस अर्थ में नहीं। इस मेज़बानी की तैयारी के द्वारा भी, हम अपनी शक्ति को सजो सकते हैं, शक्ति को प्रकट भी कर सकते हैं और हम भारत का Branding भी कर सकते हैं। क्या आप मुझे NarendraModiApp, इस पर अपने सुझाव भेज सकते हैं क्या? Logo कैसा हो, slogans कैसे हो, भारत में इस बात को फ़ैलाने के लिए क्या क्या तरीके हों, गीत कैसे हों, souvenirs बनाने हैं तो किस-किस प्रकार के souvenirs बन सकते हैं। सोचिए दोस्तो, और मैं चाहूँगा कि मेरा हर नौजवान ये 2017, FIFA, Under- 17 विश्व Cup का Ambassador बने। आप भी इसमें शरीक होइए, भारत की पहचान बनाने का सुनहरा अवसर है।\nमेरे प्यारे विद्यार्थियो, छुट्टियों के दिनों में आपने पर्यटन के लिए सोचा ही होगा। बहुत कम लोग हैं जो विदेश जाते हैं लेकिन ज्यादातर लोग अपने-अपने राज्यों में 5 दिन, 7 दिन कहीं चले जाते हैं। कुछ लोग अपने राज्यों से बाहर जाते हैं। पिछली बार भी मैंने आप लोगों से एक आग्रह किया था कि आप जहाँ जाते हैं वहाँ से फोटो upload कीजिए। और मैंने देखा कि जो काम Tourism Department नहीं कर सकता, जो काम हमारा Cultural Department नहीं कर सकता, जो काम राज्य सरकारें, भारत सरकार नहीं कर सकतीं, वो काम देश के करोड़ों-करोड़ों ऐसे प्रवासियों ने कर दिया था। ऐसी-ऐसी जगहों के फोटो upload किये गए थे कि देख कर के सचमुच में आनंद होता था। इस काम को हमें आगे बढ़ाना है इस बार भी कीजिये, लेकिन इस बार उसके साथ कुछ लिखिए। सिर्फ़ फोटो नहीं! आपकी रचनात्मक जो प्रवृति है उसको प्रकट कीजिए और नई जगह पर जाने से, देखने से बहुत कुछ सीखने को मिलता है। जो चीजें हम classroom में नहीं सीख पाते, जो हम परिवार में नहीं सीख पाते, जो चीज हम यार-दोस्तों के बीच में नहीं सीख पाते, वे कभी-कभी भ्रमण करने से ज्यादा सीखने को मिलती है और नई जगहों के नयेपन का अनुभव होता है। लोग, भाषा, खान-पान वहाँ के रहन-सहन न जाने क्या-क्या देखने को मिलता है। और किसी ने कहा है – ‘A traveller without observation. is a bird without wings’ ‘शौक-ए-दीदार है अगर, तो नज़र पैदा कर’। भारत विविधताओं से भरा हुआ है। एक बार देखने के लिए निकल पड़ो जीवन भर देखते ही रहोगे, देखते ही रहोगे! कभी मन नहीं भरेगा और मैं तो भाग्यशाली हूँ मुझे बहुत भ्रमण करने का अवसर मिला है। जब मुख्यमंत्री नहीं था, प्रधानमंत्री नहीं था और आपकी ही तरह छोटी उम्र थी, मैंने बहुत भ्रमण किया। शायद हिन्दुस्तान का कोई District नहीं होगा, जहाँ मुझे जाने का अवसर न मिला हो। ज़िन्दगी को बनाने के लिए प्रवास की एक बहुत बड़ी ताकत होती है और अब भारत के युवकों में प्रवास में साहस जुड़ता चला जा रहा है। जिज्ञासा जुड़ती चली जा रही है। पहले की तरह वो रटे-रटाये, बने-बनाये उसी route पर नहीं चला जाता है, वो कुछ नया करना चाहता है, वो कुछ नया देखना चाहता है। मैं इसे एक अच्छी निशानी मानता हूँ। हमारा युवा साहसिक हो, जहाँ कभी पैर नहीं रखा है, वहाँ पैर रखने का उसका मन होना चाहिए।\nमैं Coal India को एक विशेष बधाई देना चाहता हूँ। Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), नागपुर के पास एक सावनेर, जहाँ Coal Mines हैं। उस Coal Mines में उन्होंने Eco friendly Mine Tourism Circuit develop किया है। आम तौर पर हम लोगों की सोच है कि Coal Mines – यानि दूर ही रहना। वहाँ के लोगों की तस्वीरें जो हम देखते हैं तो हमें लगता है वहाँ जाने जैसा क्या होगा और हमारे यहाँ तो कहावत भी रहती है कि कोयले में हाथ काले, तो लोग यूँ ही दूर भागते हैं। लेकिन उसी कोयले को Tourism का destination बना देना और मैं खुश हूँ कि अभी-अभी तो ये शुरुआत हुई है और अब तक क़रीब दस हज़ार से ज्यादा लोगों ने नागपुर के पास सावनेर गाँव के निकट ये Eco friendly Mine Tourism की मुलाक़ात की है। ये अपने आप में कुछ नया देखने का अवसर देती है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि इन छुट्टियों में जब प्रवास पर जाएँ तो स्वच्छता में आप कुछ योगदान दे सकते हैं क्या?\nइन दिनों एक बात नज़र आ रही है, भले वो कम मात्रा में हो अभी भी आलोचना करनी है तो अवसर भी है लेकिन फिर भी अगर हम ये कहें कि एक जागरूकता आई है। Tourist places पर लोग स्वच्छता बनाये रखने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं। Tourist भी कर रहे हैं और जो tourist destination के स्थान पर स्थाई रूप से रहने वाले लोग भी कुछ न कुछ कर रहे हैं। हो सकता है बहुत वैज्ञानिक तरीक़े से नहीं हो रहा? लेकिन हो रहा है। आप भी एक tourist के नाते ‘tourist destination पर स्वच्छता’ उस पर आप बल दे सकते हैं क्या? मुझे विश्वास है मेरे नौजवान मुझे इसमें जरूर मदद करेंगे। और ये बात सही है कि tourism सबसे ज्यादा रोज़गार देने वाला क्षेत्र है। ग़रीब से ग़रीब व्यक्ति कमाता है और जब tourist, tourist destination पर जाता है। ग़रीब tourist जाएगा तो कुछ न कुछ तो लेगा। अमीर होगा तो ज्यादा खर्चा करेगा। और tourism के द्वारा बहुत रोज़गार की संभावना है। विश्व की तुलना में भारत tourism में अभी बहुत पीछे है। लेकिन हम सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी हम तय करें कि हमें अपने tourism को बल देना है तो हम दुनिया को आकर्षित कर सकते हैं। विश्व के tourism के एक बहुत बड़े हिस्से को हमारी ओर आकर्षित कर सकते हैं और हमारे देश के करोड़ो-करोड़ों नौजवानों को रोज़गार के अवसर उपलब्ध करा सकते हैं। सरकार हो, संस्थाएँ हों, समाज हो, नागरिक हो हम सब ने मिल करके ये करने का काम है। आइये हम उस दिशा में कुछ करने का प्रयास करें।\nमेरे युवा दोस्तो, छुट्टियाँ ऐसे ही आ कर चला जाएं, ये बात मुझे अच्छी नहीं लगती। आप भी इस दिशा में सोचिए। क्या आपकी छुट्टियाँ, ज़िन्दगी के महत्वपूर्ण वर्ष और उसका भी महत्वपूर्ण समय ऐसे ही जाने दोगे क्या? मैं आपको सोचने के लिए एक विचार रखता हूँ। क्या आप छुट्टियों में एक हुनर, अपने व्यक्तित्व में एक नई चीज़ जोड़ने का संकल्प, ये कर सकते हैं क्या? अगर आपको तैरना नहीं आता है, तो छुट्टियों मे संकल्प कर सकते हैं, मैं तैरना सीख लूँ, साईकिल चलाना नही आता है तो छुट्टियों मे तय कर लूँ मैं साईकिल चलाऊंI आज भी मैं दो उंगली से कंप्यूटर को टाइप करता हूँ, तो क्या मैं टाइपिंग सीख लूँ? हमारे व्यक्तित्व के विकास के लिए कितने प्रकार के कौशल है? क्यों ना उसको सीखें? क्यों न हमारी कुछ कमियों को दूर करें? क्यों न हम अपनी शक्तियों में इजाफ़ा करेंI अब सोचिए और कोई उसमें बहुत बड़े classes चाहिए कोई trainer चाहिए, बहुत बड़ी fees चाहिए, बड़ा budget चाहिए ऐसा नहीं है। आप अपने अगल-बगल में भी मान लीजिये आप तय करें कि मैं waste में से best बनाऊंगा। कुछ देखिये और उसमे से बनाना शुरू कर दीजिये। देखिये आप को आनंद आयेगा शाम होते-होते देखिये ये कूड़े-कचरे में से आपने क्या बना दिया। आप को painting का शौक है, आता नही है, अरे तो शुरू कर दीजिये ना, आ जायेगा। आप अपनी छुट्टियों का समय अपने व्यक्तित्व के विकास के लिए, अपने पास कोई एक नए हुनर के लिए, अपने कौशल-विकास के लिए अवश्य करें और अनगिनत क्षेत्र हो सकते हैं जरुरी नहीं है, कि मैं जो गिना रहा हूँ वही क्षेत्र हो सकते है। और आपके व्यक्तित्व की पहचान उससे और उससे आप का आत्मविश्वास इतना बढ़ेगा इतना बढ़ेगा। एक बार देख लीजिये जब छुट्टियों के बाद स्कूल में वापिस जाओगे, कॉलेज मे वापिस जाओगे और अपने साथियों को कहोगे कि भाई मैंने तो छुट्टीयों मे ये सीख लिया और अगर उसने नहीं सिखा होगा, तो वो सोचेगा कि यार मेरा तो बर्बाद हो गया तुम बड़े पक्के हो यार कुछ करके आ गए। ये अपने साथियों मे शायद बात होगी। मुझे विश्वास है कि आप ज़रूर करेंगे। और मुझे बताइए कि आप ने क्या सीखा। बतायेंगे ना!। इस बार ‘मन की बात’ में My-gov पर कई सुझाव आये हैं।\n‘मेरा नाम अभि चतुर्वेदी है। नमस्ते प्रधानमंत्री जी, आपने पिछले गर्मियों की छुट्टियों में बोला कि चिड़ियों को भी गर्मी लगती है, तो हमने एक बर्तन में पानी में रखकर अपनी बालकोनी में या छत पर रख देना चाहिये, जिससे चिड़िया आकर पानी पी लें। मैंने ये काम किया और मेरे को आनंद आया, इसी बहाने मेरी बहुत सारी चिड़ियों से दोस्ती हो गयी। मैं आपसे विनती करता हूँ कि आप इस कार्य को वापस ‘मन की बात’ में दोहराएँ।’\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैं अभि चतुर्वेदी का आभारी हूँ इस बालक ने मुझे याद कराया वैसे मैं भूल गया था। और मेरे मन में नहीं था कि आज मैं इस विषय पर कुछ कहूँगा लेकिन उस अभि ने मुझे याद करवाया कि पिछले वर्ष मैंने पक्षियों के लिए घर के बाहर मिट्टी के बर्तन में। मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो मैं अभि चतुर्वेदी एक बालक का आभार व्यक्त करना चाहता हूँ। उसने मुझे फोन करके एक अच्छा काम याद करवा दिया। पिछली बार तो मुझे याद था। और मैंने कहा था कि गर्मियों के दिनों मे पक्षियों के लिए अपने घर के बाहर मिट्टी के बर्तनों मे पानी रखे। अभि ने मुझे बताया कि वो साल भर से इस काम को कर रहा है। और उसकी कई चिड़िया उसकी दोस्त बन गई है। हिन्दी की महान कवि महादेवी वर्मा वो पक्षियों को बहुत प्यार करती थीं। उन्होंने अपनी कविता में लिखा था – तुझको दूर न जाने देंगे, दानों से आंगन भर देंगे और होद में भर देंगे हम मीठा-मीठा ठंडा पानी। आइये महादेवी जी की इस बात को हम भी करें। मैं अभि को अभिनन्दन भी देता हूँ और आभार भी व्यक्त करता हूँ कि तुमने मुझको बहुत महत्वपूर्ण बात याद कराई।\nमैसूर से शिल्पा कूके, उन्होंने एक बड़ा संवेदनशील मुद्दा हम सब के लिए रखा है। उन्होंने कहा है कि हमारे घर के पास दूध बेचने वाले आते हैं, अख़बार बेचने वाले आते हैं, Postman आते हैं। कभी कोई बर्तन बेचने वाले वहाँ से गुजरते हैं, कपड़े बेचने वाले गुजरते हैं। क्या कभी हमने उनको गर्मियों के दिनों मे पानी के लिए पूछा है क्या? क्या कभी हमने उसको पानी offer किया है क्या? शिल्पा मैं आप का बहुत आभारी हूँ आपने बहुत संवेदनशील विषय को बड़े सामान्य सरल तरीके से रख दिया। ये बात सही है बात छोटी होती है लेकिन गर्मी के बीच अगर postman घर के पास आया और हमने पानी पिलाया कितना अच्छा लगेगा उसको। खैर भारत में तो ये स्वाभाव है ही है। लेकिन शिल्पा मैं आभारी हूँ कि तुमने इन चीज़ों को observe किया।\nमेरे प्यारे किसान भाइयो और बहनो, Digital India – Digital India आपने बहुत सुना होगा। कुछ लोगों को लगता है कि Digital India तो शहर के नौजवानों की दुनिया है। जी नही, आपको खुशी होगी कि एक “किसान सुविधा App” आप सब की सेवा में प्रस्तुत किया है। ये “किसान सुविधा App” के माध्यम से अगर आप उसको अपने Mobile-Phone में download करते हैं तो आपको कृषि सम्बन्धी, weather सम्बन्धी बहुत सारी जानकारियाँ अपनी हथेली में ही मिल जाएगी। बाज़ार का हाल क्या है, मंडियों में क्या स्थिति है, इन दिनों अच्छी फसल का क्या दौर चल रहा है, दवाइयां कौन-सी उपयुक्त होती हैं? कई विषय उस पर है। इतना ही नहीं इसमें एक बटन ऐसा है कि जो सीधा-सीधा आपको कृषि वैज्ञानिकों के साथ जोड़ देता है, expert के साथ जोड़ देता है। अगर आप अपना कोई सवाल उसके सामने रखोगे तो वो जवाब देता है, समझाता है, आपको। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि मेरे किसान भाई-बहन इस “किसान सुविधा App” को अपने Mobile-Phone पर download करें। try तो कीजिए उसमें से आपके काम कुछ आता है क्या? और फिर भी कुछ कमी महसूस होती है तो आप मुझे शिकायत भी कर दीजिये।\nमेरे किसान भाइयो और बहनों, बाकियों के लिए तो गर्मी छुट्टियों के लिए अवसर रहा है। लेकिन किसान के लिए तो और भी पसीना बहाने का अवसर बन जाता है। वो वर्षा का इंतजार करता है और इंतजार के पहले किसान अपने खेत को तैयार करने के लिए जी-जान से जुट जाता है, ताकि वो बारिश की एक बूंद भी बर्बाद नहीं होने देना चाहता है। किसान के लिए, किसानी के season शुरू होने का समय बड़ा ही महत्वपूर्ण होता है। लेकिन हम देशवासियो को भी सोचना होगा कि पानी के बिना क्या होगा? क्या ये समय हम अपने तालाब, अपने यहाँ पानी बहने के रास्ते तालाबों में पानी आने के जो मार्ग होते हैं जहाँ पर कूड़ा-कचरा या कुछ न कुछ encroachment हो जाता तो पानी आना बंद हो जाता है और उसके कारण जल-संग्रह धीरे-धीरे कम होता जा रहा है। क्या हम उन पुरानी जगहों को फिर से एक बार खुदाई करके, सफाई करके अधिक जल-संचय के लिए तैयार कर सकते हैं क्या? जितना पानी बचायेंगे तो पहली बारिश में भी अगर पानी बचा लिया, तालाब भर गए, हमारे नदी नाले भर गए तो कभी पीछे बारिश रूठ भी जाये तो हमारा नुकसान कम होता है।\nइस बार आपने देखा होगा 5 लाख तालाब, खेत-तालाब बनाने का बीड़ा उठाया है। मनरेगा से भी जल-संचय के लिए assets create करने की तरफ बल दिया है। गाँव-गाँव पानी बचाओ, आने वाली बारिश में बूँद-बूँद पानी कैसे बचाएँ। गाँव का पानी गाँव में रहे, ये अभियान कैसे चलायें, आप योजना बनाइए, सरकार की योजनाओं से जुड़िए ताकि एक ऐसा जन-आंदोलन खड़ा करें, ताकि हम पानी से एक ऐसा जन-आन्दोलन खड़ा करें जिसके पानी का माहत्म्य भी समझें और पानी संचय के लिए हर कोई जुड़े। देश में कई ऐसे गाँव होंगे, कई ऐसे प्रगतिशील किसान होंगे, कई ऐसे जागरूक नागरिक होंगे जिन्होंने इस काम को किया होगा। लेकिन फिर भी अभी और ज्यादा करने की आवश्यकता है।\nमेरे किसान भाइयो-बहनों, मैं एक बार आज फिर से दोहराना चाहता हूँ। क्योंकि पिछले दिनों भारत सरकार ने एक बहुत बड़ा किसान मेला लगाया था और मैंने देखा कि क्या-क्या आधुनिक technology आई है, और कितना बदलाव आया है, कृषि क्षेत्र में, लेकिन फिर भी उसे खेतों तक पहुँचाना है और अब किसान भी कहने लगा है कि भई अब तो fertilizer कम करना है। मैं इसका स्वागत करता हूँ। अधिक fertilizer के दुरुपयोग ने हमारी धरती माँ को बीमार कर दिया है और हम धरती माँ के बेटे हैं, सन्तान हैं हम अपनी धरती माँ को बीमार कैसे देख सकते हैं। अच्छे मसाले डालें तो खाना कितना बढ़िया बनता है, लेकिन अच्छे से अच्छे मसाले भी अगर ज्यादा मात्रा में दाल दें तो वो खाना खाने का मन करता है क्या? वही खाना बुरा लगता है न? ये fertilizer का भी ऐसा ही है, कितना ही उत्तम fertilizer क्यों न हो, लेकिन हद से ज्यादा fertilizer का उपयोग करेंगे तो वो बर्बादी का कारण बन जायेगा। हर चीज़ balance होनी चाहिये और इससे खर्चा भी कम होगा, पैसे आपके बचेंगे। और हमारा तो मत है – कम cost ज्यादा output, “कम लागत, ज्यादा पावत”, इसी मंत्र को ले करके चलना चाहिए और वैज्ञानिक तौर-तरीकों से हम अपने कृषि को आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि जल संचय में जो भी आवश्यक काम करना पड़े, हमारे पास एक-दो महीने हैं बारिश आने तक, हम पूरे मनोयोग से इसको करें। जितना पानी बचेगा किसानी को उतना ही ज्यादा लाभ होगा, ज़िन्दगी उतनी ही ज्यादा बचेगी।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, 7 अप्रैल को ‘World Health Day’ है और इस बार दुनिया ने ‘World Health Day’ को ‘beat Diabetes’ इस theme पर केन्द्रित किया है। diabetes को परास्त करिए। Diabetes एक ऐसा मेजबान है कि वो हर बीमारी की मेजबानी करने के लिए आतुर रहता है। एक बार अगर diabetes घुस गया तो उसके पीछे ढेर सारे बीमारी कुरुपी मेहमान अपने घर में, शरीर में घुस जाते हैं। कहते हैं 2014 में भारत में क़रीब साडे छः करोड़ diabetes के मरीज थे। 3 प्रतिशत मृत्यु का कारण कहते हैं कि diabetes पाया गया। और diabetes के दो प्रकार होते हैं एक Type-1, Type-2. Type- 1 में वंशगत रहता है, hereditary है, माता-पिता को है इसलिए बालक को होता है। और Type-2 आदतों के कारण, उम्र के कारण, मोटापे के कारण। हम उसको निमंत्रण देकर के बुलाते हैं। दुनिया diabetes से चिंतित है, इसलिए 7 तारीक को ‘World Health Day’ में इसको theme रखा गया है। हम सब जानते हैं कि हमारी life style उसके लिए सबसे बड़ा कारण है। शरीरिक श्रम कम हो रहा है। पसीने का नाम-ओ-निशान नहीं है, चलना-फिरना हो नहीं रहा है। खेल भी खेलेंगे तो online खेलते है, off-line कुछ नहीं हो रहा है। क्या हम, 7 तारीख से कुछ प्रेरणा ले कर के अपने निजी जीवन में diabetes को परास्त करने के लिए कुछ कर सकते है क्या? आपको योग में रूचि है तो योग कीजिए नहीं तो कम से कम दौड़ने चलने के लिए तो जाइये। अगर मेरे देश का हर नागरिक स्वस्थ होगा तो मेरा भारत भी तो स्वस्थ होगा। कभी कबार हम संकोचवश medical check-up नहीं करवाते हैं। और फिर बहुत बुरे हाल होने के बाद ध्यान में आता है कि ओह… हो… मेरा तो बहुत पुराना diabetes था। Check करने में क्या जाता है इतना तो कर लीजिये और अब तो सारी बातें उपलब्ध हैं। बहुत आसानी से हो जाती हैं। आप ज़रूर उसकी चिंता कीजिए।\n24 मार्च को दुनिया ने TB Day मनाया। हम जानते है, जब मैं छोटा था तो TB का नाम सुनते ही डर जाते थे। ऐसा लगता था कि बस अब तो मौत आ गयी। लेकिन अब TB से डर नहीं लगता है। क्योंकि सबको मालूम है कि TB का उपचार हो सकता है, और असानी से हो सकता है। लेकिन जब TB और मौत जुड़ गए थे तो हम डरते थे लेकिन अब TB के प्रति हम बेपरवाह हो गए हैं। लेकिन दुनिया की तुलना में TB के मरीजों की संख्या बहुत है। TB से अगर मुक्ति पानी है तो एक तो correct treatment चाहिये और complete treatment चाहिये। सही उपचार हो और पूरा उपचार हो। बीच में से छोड़ दिया तो वो मुसीबत नई पैदा कर देता है। अच्छा TB तो एक ऐसी चीज़ है कि अड़ोस-पड़ोस के लोग भी तय कर सकते है कि अरे भई check करो देखो, TB हो गया होगा। ख़ासी आ रही है, बुखार रहता है, वज़न कम होने लगता है। तो अड़ोस-पड़ोस को भी पता चल जाता है कि देखो यार कहीं उसको TB-VB तो नहीं हुआ। इसका मतलब हुआ कि ये बीमारी ऐसी है कि जिसको जल्द जाँच की जा सकती है।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, इस दिशा में बहुत काम हो रहा है। तेरह हज़ार पांच सौ से अधिक Microscopy Centre हैं। चार लाख से अधिक DOT provider हैं। अनेक advance labs हैं और सारी सेवाएँ मुफ़्त में हैं। आप एक बार जाँच तो करा लीजिए। और ये बीमारी जा सकती है। बस सही उपचार हो और बीमारी नष्ट होने तक उपचार जारी रहे। मैं आपसे आग्रह करूँगा कि चाहे TB हो या Diabetes हो हमें उसे परास्त करना है। भारत को हमें इन बीमारियों से मुक्ति दिलानी है। लेकिन ये सरकार, डॉक्टर, दवाई से नहीं होता है जब तक की आप न करें। और इसलिए मैं आज मेरे देशवासियों से आग्रह करता हूँ कि हम diabetes को परास्त करें। हम TB से मुक्ति पायें।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, अप्रैल महीने में कई महत्वपूर्ण अवसर आ रहे हैं। विशेष कर 14 अप्रैल भीमराव बाबा साहिब अम्बेडकर का जन्मदिन। उनकी 125वी जयंती साल भर पूरे देश में मनाई गयी। एक पंचतीर्थ, मऊ उनका जन्म् स्थान, London में उनकी शिक्षा हुई, नागपुर में उनकी दीक्षा हुई, 26-अलीपुर रोड, दिल्ली में उनका महापरिनिर्वाण हुआ और मुंबई में जहाँ उनका अन्तिम संस्कार हुआ वो चैत्य भूमि। इन पाँचों तीर्थ के विकास के लिए हम लगातार कोशिश कर रहे हैं। मेरा सौभाग्य है कि मुझे इस वर्ष 14 अप्रैल को मुझे बाबा साहिब अम्बेडकर की जन्मस्थली मऊ जाने का सौभाग्य मिल रहा है। एक उत्तम नागरिक बनने के लिए बाबा साहिब ने हमने बहुत कुछ दिया है। उस रास्ते पर चल कर के एक उत्तम नागरिक बन कर के उनको हम बहुत बड़ी श्रधांजलि दे सकते हैं।\nकुछ ही दिनों में, विक्रम संवत् की शुरुआत होगी। नया विक्रम संवत् आएगा। अलग-अलग राज्यों में अलग-अलग रूप से मनाया जाता है। कोई इसे नव संवत्सर कहता है, कोई गुड़ी-पड़वा कहता है, कोई वर्ष प्रतिप्रता कहता है, कोई उगादी कहता है। लेकिन हिन्दुस्तान के क़रीब-क़रीब सभी क्षत्रों में इसका महात्म्यं है। मेरी नव वर्ष के लिए सब को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं है।\nआप जानते हैं, मैं पिछली बार भी कहा था कि मेरे ‘मन की बात’ को सुनने के लिए, कभी भी सुन सकते हैं। क़रीब-क़रीब 20 भाषाओँ में सुन सकते हैं। आपके अपने समय पर सुन सकते हैं। आपके अपने मोबाइल फ़ोन पर सुन सकते हैं। बस सिर्फ आपको एक missed call करना होता है। और मुझे ख़ुशी है कि इस सेवा का लाभ अभी तो एक महीना बड़ी मुश्किल से हुआ है। लेकिन 35 लाख़ लोगों ने इसका फायदा उठाया। आप भी नंबर लिख लीजिये 81908-81908. मैं repeat करता हूँ 81908-81908. आप missed call करिए और जब भी आपकी सुविधा हो पुरानी ‘मन की बात’ भी सुनना चाहते हो तो भी सुन सकते हो, आपकी अपनी भाषा में सुन सकते हो। मुझे ख़ुशी होगी आपके साथ जुड़े रहने की।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आपको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद।\n"

        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

এই পুরো বছর জুড়ে আমরা এক ফুটবল-ফুটবল পরিবেশ তৈরি করে তুলতে পারি। স্কুলে, কলেজে, দেশের প্রতিটি কোণে আমাদের যুবা প্রজন্ম, আমাদের স্কুলের ছেলেরা তাদের ঘাম ঝরাক। চতুর্দিকে ফুটবল খেলা হোক। যদি এটা করতে পারি, তবেই তো আয়োজনের মজা আসবে আর এই জন্য আমাদের সবার প্রচেষ্টা হওয়া উচিত ফুটবলকে গ্রামে গ্রামে অলিতে গলিতে পৌঁছে দেওয়ার। ২০১৭ ফিফা অনূর্দ্ধ-১৭ বিশ্বকাপ এমনই এক সুযোগ। এই এক বছরের মধ্যে আমরা চারদিকে যুবপ্রজন্মের মধ্যে ফুটবলের জন্য এক নতুন উদ্যম, এক নতুন উৎসাহ তৈরি করি। এই আয়োজনের একটা লাভ তো আমাদের আছেই, আমাদের এখানে পরিকাঠামো তৈরি হবে, খেলার জন্য যে সব সুযোগ-সুবিধা আবশ্যক, তার প্রতি মনোযোগ পড়বে। আমি তো তখনই এর আনন্দ পাব যখন যুব প্রজন্মের প্রত্যেককে ফুটবলের সঙ্গে যুক্ত করতে পারব।\nবন্ধুরা, আপনাদের কাছে আমার এক প্রত্যাশা আছে। ২০১৭-র এই আয়োজন, এই সুযোগ কেমন হবে, আমাদের ফুটবলে গতি আনার জন্য বছরভর কী কী পরিকল্পনা করতে হবে, কী ধরনের প্রচার করতে হবে, বর্তমান ব্যবস্থায় কী সংশোধন করতে হবে, ফিফা অনূর্দ্ধ-১৭ বিশ্বকাপের মাধ্যমে নতুন প্রজন্মের খেলার প্রতি আগ্রহ কীভাবে বাড়ানো যায়, সরকারী স্তরে, প্রশিক্ষণ সংস্থাগুলিতে, অন্যান্য সামাজিক সংগঠনগুলিকে খেলার সঙ্গে কীভাবে যুক্ত করা যায়, তা নিয়ে ভাবনা-চিন্তা করুন। ক্রিকেটে আমরা এই সবকিছু দেখতে পাই, কিন্তু অন্যান্য খেলার ক্ষেত্রেও এই জিনিসগুলি আনতে হবে। ফুটবল এক সুযোগ। আপনারা কি আমাকে এই ব্যাপারে পরামর্শ দিতে পারেন? বিশ্বের সামনে ভারতের সম্মান বাড়ানোর এ এক মস্ত বড় অবসর বলে আমার মনে হয়। ভারতের যুবশক্তিকে বিশ্বের কাছে পরিচিত করার এ এক সুযোগ বলে আমার মনে হয়। ম্যাচের সময় কি পেলাম, কি হারালাম এই অর্থে নয় – এই আয়োজন করার মাধ্যমে আমাদের নিজস্ব ক্ষমতাকে ঐক্যবদ্ধ করতে পারি, শক্তি প্রদর্শন করতে পারি, আর ভারতের ‘ব্র্যান্ডিং’-ও করতে পারি। আপনারা কি নরেন্দ্র মোদী অ্যাপ-এ আপনাদের পরামর্শ পাঠাতে পারেন? লোগো কীরকম হবে, স্লোগান কীরকম হবে, সারা দেশে এই বিষয়ে উৎসাহ তৈরি করার জন্য কী কী করা উচিত, থিম সং কীরকম হবে, স্যুভেনির কী কী রকম তৈরি করা যেতে পারে – বন্ধুরা ভাবুন, আর আমি চাই যে, আমার প্রতিটি নওজোয়ান এই ২০১৭-র ফিফা অনূর্দ্ধ-১৭ বিশ্বকাপের দূত হয়ে উঠুন। ভারতের এক নতুন পরিচয় তুলে ধরার এই সুন্দর সুযোগে আপনারা সবাই সামিল হোন।\nআমার প্রিয় বিদ্যার্থীরা, ছুটির সময় কোথায় বেড়াতে যাবেন তা নিয়ে নিশ্চয়ই ভাবনা-চিন্তা করেছেন। খুব কম মানুষই আছেন, যাঁরা বিদেশ যান, বেশির ভাগ মানুষই নিজের নিজের রাজ্যে কোথাও না কোথাও ৫ দিন – ৭ দিনের জন্য বেড়াতে যান। কিছু মানুষ রাজ্যের বাইরেও যান। আগের বারেও আমি আপনাদের বলেছিলাম, আপনারা যেখানেই যান না কেন, সেখান থেকে ফোটো আপলোড করুন। আর আমি দেখেছি যে, যে কাজ পর্যটন দপ্তর, সংস্কৃতি দপ্তর, রাজ্য সরকার ও ভারত সরকার করতে পারে নি, সেই কাজ দেশের এই রকম কোটি কোটি পর্যটক করে দিয়েছেন। এমন এমন জায়গার ফোটো আপলোড করেছেন যে দেখে সত্যিই আনন্দ পেয়েছি। এই কাজকে আমাদের এগিয়ে নিয়ে যেতে হবে। এবারেও আপনারা একইরকম ভাবে করুন, তবে এবার তার সঙ্গে কিছু লিখুন – শুধু ফোটোই নয়। আপনার লেখার যে ক্ষমতা আছে, তার প্রদর্শন করুন আর নতুন জায়গা দেখলে অনেক কিছু শেখার সুযোগ হয় – যে জিনিস আমরা শ্রেণিকক্ষে শিখতে পারি না, যা আমরা আমাদের পরিবারে শিখতে পারি না, যে জিনিস আমরা বন্ধুদের কাছ থেকে শিখতে পারি না, তা কখনও কখনও পর্যটনের মাধ্যমে শেখার অনেক বেশি সুযোগ পাওয়া যায় আর নতুন জায়গার নতুনত্বকে অনুভব করা যায়। লোক, ভাষা, খাওয়া-দাওয়া, সেখানকার আদব-কায়দা, না জানি আরও কত কিছু দেখার সুযোগ পাওয়া যায়। আর সেই যে বলা হয় – ‘A traveller without observation is a bird without wing’। ভাল জিনিস দেখার শখ থাকলে নজরটাও তৈরি করতে হয়। ভারত বৈচিত্রে ভরা এক দেশ। একবার দেখার জন্য বেরিয়ে পড়ুন, জীবনভোর দেখতেই থাকবেন, দেখতেই থাকবেন। কখনই মন ভরবে না। আর আমি তো ভাগ্যবান, আমি ভ্রমণ করার অনেক সুযোগ পেয়েছি। যখন মুখ্যমন্ত্রী ছিলাম না, প্রধানমন্ত্রী ছিলাম না, আর আপনাদের মত অল্প বয়সের ছিলাম, আমি অনেক ঘুরেছি। বোধহয় ভারতবর্ষের এমন কোনও জেলা নেই, যেখানে আমার যাওয়ার সুযোগ হয় নি। জীবনকে তৈরি করার জন্য পর্যটনের এক বড় ভূমিকা আছে। আর এখন ভারতের যুবকরা সাহসের সঙ্গে পর্যটনে চলে যাচ্ছেন, কৌতূহল নিরসন করতে চলে যাচ্ছেন। আগের মত তাঁরা গতানুগতিক পথে না চলে, নতুন কিছু করতে চাইছেন – নতুন কিছু দেখতে চাইছেন। আমি একে একটা খুব ভাল নিদর্শন বলে মানি। আমাদের যুব প্রজন্ম সাহসী, যেখানে কেউ পা রাখেনি, সেখানে পৌঁছনোর চেষ্টা তাঁদের থাকা উচিত।\nআমি কোল ইণ্ডিয়া-কে বিশেষ ভাবে ধন্যবাদ দিতে চাই। নাগপুরের কাছে সাওনের-এ যেখানে কয়লাখনি আছে, সেখানকার ওয়েস্টার্ণ কোলফিল্ড লিমিটেড এক পরিবেশ বান্ধব ‘খনি পর্যটন এলাকা’ তৈরি করেছে। সাধারণত আমাদের মত মানুষের ভাবনাচিন্তা হচ্ছে – কয়লাখনি? তাহলে দূরেই থাকি। আমরা যখন সেখানকার মানুষের ছবি দেখি, আমাদের মনে হয় যে ওখানে গিয়ে কী লাভ। আর কথাই তো আছে যে কয়লাতে হাত কালো হয়, সেজন্যই লোক খনি থেকে দূরে চলে যায়। কিন্তু সেই কয়লা খনিকেই পর্যটনকেন্দ্র হিসেবে গড়ে তোলা? আর আমি খুশি যে এই তো সবে শুরু, এখন পর্যন্ত প্রায় দশ হাজারেরও বেশি মানুষ নাগপুরের কাছে সাওনের গ্রামে পরিবেশ বান্ধব খনি পর্যটন কেন্দ্র দেখেছেন। এই জায়গা নিজেই নতুন জিনিস দেখার সুযোগ করে দিচ্ছে। আমি আশা করব, ছুটিতে যদি আপনারা বাইরে বেড়াতে যান, তাহলে পরিচ্ছন্নতার বিষয়েও কিছু কাজ আপনারা করতে পারবেন। আজকাল একটা জিনিস দেখা যাচ্ছে – এই ব্যাপারে কম বা বেশি যা-ই হোক, আলোচনা কিন্তু হচ্ছে। হয়ত ব্যতিক্রমও আছে, তবু একটা সচেতনতা যে এসেছে – একথা বলা যেতেই পারে। পর্যটন ক্ষেত্রগুলিতে মানুষ পরিচ্ছন্নতা বজায় রাখার চেষ্টা করছেন। পর্যটকরাও এই চেষ্টায় সামিল হচ্ছেন। পর্যটন কেন্দ্রগুলিতে যাঁরা স্থায়ীভাবে বসবাস করেন, তাঁরাও এই কাজে যোগ দিচ্ছেন। হয়ত খুব বেশি বৈজ্ঞানিকভাবে কাজ হচ্ছে না, কিন্তু হচ্ছে। আপনিও কি একজন পর্যটক হিসেবে পর্যটন কেন্দ্রের স্বচ্ছতায় গুরুত্ব দিতে পারেন না? আমার স্থির বিশ্বাস, আমাদের যুব বন্ধুরা এই বিষয়ে অবশ্যই সহায়তা করবেন। আর একথা সত্যি যে, পর্যটন থেকে সবচেয়ে বেশি আয় হয়, অত্যন্ত দরিদ্র লোকেরাও এই ক্ষেত্র থেকে রোজগার করতে পারেন। পর্যটক যখন কোথাও বেড়াতে যান, তখন দরিদ্র হলেও তিনি কিছু তো কিনবেনই – ধনী হলে খরচের পরিমাণ হবে বেশি। অতএব পর্যটন থেকে প্রচুর রোজগারের সম্ভাবনা আছে। পৃথিবীর অন্যান্য দেশের তুলনায় ভারত এখনও পর্যটনে অনেক পিছিয়ে আছে। কিন্তু আমরা একশো পঁচিশ কোটি দেশবাসী যদি মনে করি যে আমাদের পর্যটনকে শক্তিশালী করতে হবে, তাহলে আমরা অবশ্যই সারা বিশ্বকে আকর্ষণ করতে পারি। বিশ্বপর্যটনের এক বড় অংশকে আমরা এইভাবে নিজেদের দিকে টেনে নিতে পারি। আর তাহলে আমাদের দেশের কোটি কোটি নব্য যুবার রোজগারের উপায় করে দেওয়া সম্ভব হবে। সরকার হোক, সংস্থা হোক, সমাজ হোক বা নাগরিক – এই কাজ সবাই মিলে করতে হবে। আসুন, আমরা সেই উদ্দেশ্যে কিছু কাজ করি।\nআমার যুবা বন্ধুরা, ছুটিগুলো এমনি এমনি আসে আর চলে যায় – এটা আমার ভাল লাগে না। আপনারাও এই বিষয়টি ভাবুন। আপনারাও কি আপনাদের ছুটি, জীবনের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বছরগুলো, মহত্বপূর্ণ এই সময়গুলো এইভাবেই চলে যেতে দেবেন? আমি কতকগুলো বিষয় বলছি – আপনারা ভেবে দেখতে পারেন। আপনারা কি এই ছুটিতে নিজেদের ব্যক্তিত্বের সঙ্গে আরও কোনও বাড়তি গুণ যোগ করার সঙ্কল্প নিতে পারেন না? যদি আপনি সাঁতার না জানেন তবে ছুটিতে সাঁতার শিখে নেওয়ার সঙ্কল্প করতে পারেন। যদি সাইকেল চালানো না জানা থাকে তাহলে পণ করুন, ছুটির দিনগুলোতে সাইকেল চালানো শিখবেন। আমি আজ পর্যন্ত দু’আঙুলে কম্পিউটার টাইপ করি – তাহলে কি টাইপিংটা শিখে নেব? আমাদের ব্যক্তিত্বের বিকাশ ঘটাবার কতরকম কৌশলই না আছে – সেগুলোই শিখি না কেন! নাহয় আমাদের ঘাটতিগুলোকেই দূর করি। আমাদের নিজেদের শক্তিকে আরও বাড়াই। ভেবে দেখুন, এর জন্য যে খুব বড় কোনও ক্লাস দরকার, কোনও প্রশিক্ষক দরকার, বিরাট অঙ্কের ফিজ্‌ বা বড় বাজেট চাই – তা নয়। নিজের আশেপাশে তাকিয়ে দেখে যদি মনে করেন – ফেলে দেওয়া জিনিস থেকে আপনি দারুণ কিছু বানাতে পারেন – তবে শুরু করে দিন, দেখুন কত আনন্দ পাবেন। দিনের শেষে দেখবেন জঞ্জাল থেকে আপনি কী অপূর্ব জিনিস বানিয়েছেন। আপনার ছবি আঁকার শখ আছে, কিন্তু ছবি আঁকতে পারেন না – আরে শুরু করেই দেখুন না, ঠিক এসে যাবে। ছুটির সময়টাতে নিজের ব্যক্তিত্ব বিকাশের জন্য, নিজের ক্ষমতা, কর্মকুশলতা বাড়ানোর জন্য কিছু করুন। শুধু আমি যে ক্ষেত্রগুলির কথা বললাম, তা-ই নয়, তার বাইরে আরও অজস্র কাজের সুযোগ আছে। এর ফলে আপনার ব্যক্তিত্ব, আপনার আত্মবিশ্বাস যে কতখানি বেড়ে যাবে – দেখে নেবেন। ছুটির শেষে যখন স্কুল বা কলেজে ফিরে যাবেন, আর গিয়ে বন্ধুদের বলবেন – ভাই, আমি ছুটিতে এইটা শিখেছি; দেখবেন, যদি তারা কিছু না শিখে থাকে, তো ভাববে, এই যাঃ, আমার তো সর্বনাশ হয়ে গেল। তুমি তো দারুণ বুদ্ধিমান, কিছু শিখে এসেছো। বন্ধুদের মধ্যে এটা নিয়ে কথা হবে। আমি নিশ্চিত, আপনারা নিশ্চয়ই কিছু করবেন এবং আমাকে জানাবেন যে কী শিখলেন। কি – জানাবেন তো?\nএবারের ‘মন কি বাত’-এর জন্য ‘মাই গভ’ পোর্টালে কিছু পরামর্শ এসেছে। যেমন –\n“আমার নাম অভি চতুর্বেদী। নমস্কার, প্রধানমন্ত্রীজী, গতবার গরমের ছুটিতে আপনি বলেছিলেন, পাখিদেরও গরম লাগে। একটি পাত্রে জল ভরে আমাদের ব্যালকনি বা ছাদে রেখে দেওয়া দরকার। যা থেকে পাখিরা এসে জল খেয়ে যেতে পারবে। আমি এই কাজটি করে আনন্দ পেয়েছি। এই সুযোগে অনেক পাখির সঙ্গে আমার বন্ধুত্বও হয়ে গেছে। আমার অনুরোধ, আপনি ‘মন কি বাত’-এ এই বিষয়টা আবার বলুন। ধন্যবাদ!”\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসীগণ, আমি অভি চতুর্বেদী নামে এই বালকটিকে আমার কৃতজ্ঞতা জানাতে চাই। সে আমাকে একটা ভালো কাজের কথা মনে করিয়ে দিয়েছে। গতবার আমার মনে ছিল। আর তাই আমি বলেছিলাম যে, গরমের দিনে পাখিদের জন্য ঘরের বাইরে মাটির পাত্রে জল রাখুন। অভি আমাকে জানিয়েছে, সে সারা বছর এই কাজ করে চলেছে এবং অনেক পাখি তার বন্ধু হয়ে গেছে। হিন্দির মহান কবি মহাদেবী বর্মা পাখিদের খুব ভালবাসতেন। নিজের কবিতায় তিনি লিখেছিলেন – “তোকে দূরে যেতে দেবো না, উঠোন ভরে দেবো দানায়, পাত্রে ভরে দেবো মিষ্টি ঠাণ্ডা জল।” আসুন মহাদেবীজী-র এই কথাকে আমরা কাজে পরিণত করি। আমি অভিকে অভিনন্দন জানাচ্ছি, সেইসঙ্গে কৃতজ্ঞতাও জানাচ্ছি – তুমি আমাকে খুব গুরুত্বপূর্ণ কথা মনে করিয়ে দিয়েছো।\nমহীশূর থেকে শিল্পা কুকে আমাদের সকলের জন্য একটা খুব সংবেদনশীল বিষয় তুলে ধরেছেন। তিনি বলেছেন, আমাদের বাড়ির পাশে দুধওয়ালা, খবরের কাগজওয়ালা, পোস্টম্যান আসেন। কখনও কখনও বাসনওয়ালা, কাপড় বিক্রিওয়ালাও ওই পথ দিয়ে যান। গরমের দিনে আমরা কি কখনও তাঁদের জল পান করতে ডেকেছি, কখনও কি জল দিয়েছি তাঁদের? শিল্পা, আমি আপনার প্রতি বিশেষ কৃতজ্ঞ। কারণ আপনি এক অতি সংবেদনশীল বিষয়কে খুব সহজভাবে তুলে ধরেছেন। এটা ঠিক কথা। ব্যাপারটা খুবই সামান্য, কিন্তু গরমের সময় যদি পোস্টম্যান বাড়ির পাশে আসেন, আর আমরা তাঁকে জল খাওয়াই, তাহলে তাঁর কত ভাল লাগবে! অবশ্য ভারতের তো এটাই পরম্পরা। কিন্তু শিল্পা, আমি কৃতজ্ঞ। কারণ আপনি এই জিনিসটা লক্ষ্য করেছেন।\nআমার প্রিয় কৃষক ভাইবোনেরা, আপনারা ডিজিট্যাল ইণ্ডিয়ার কথা অনেক শুনেছেন। কিছু লোকের মনে হয়, ডিজিট্যাল ইণ্ডিয়া তো শহরের তরুণদের জগৎ! কিন্তু না, আপনারা শুনে খুশি হবেন যে, আপনাদের সকলের সুবিধার্থে একটি ‘কিসান সুবিধা অ্যাপ’ তৈরি করা হয়েছে। আপনারা যদি এই অ্যাপটি আপনাদের মোবাইল ফোনে ডাউনলোড করে নেন, তাহলে কৃষি এবং আবহাওয়া সম্পর্কিত বহু তথ্য আপনার হাতে চলে আসবে। বাজারের অবস্থা কেমন, পাইকারি বাজারের পরিস্থিতি কি, এই সময়ে ভাল ফসলের যোগান কেমন, উপযুক্ত ওষুধ কোনটি, ইত্যাদি অনেক বিষয়ই এই অ্যাপে আছে। শুধু তা-ই নয়, এতে এমন একটি বাটন আছে, যা টিপলে সরাসরি কৃষি বিজ্ঞানীদের সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ স্থাপন করা যায়। আর যদি আপনি কোনও প্রশ্ন তাঁদের সামনে রাখেন, তাঁরা তার জবাব দেবেন এবং আপনাকে বুঝিয়েও দেবেন। আমি আশা করি, আমার কৃষক ভাই-বোনেরা এই ‘কিসান সুবিধা অ্যাপ’ নিজেদের মোবাইল ফোনে ডাউনলোড করবেন। চেষ্টা করে তো দেখুন, এটা আপনার কাজে লাগছে কিনা। যদি কোনও অসুবিধা থাকে তবে আমাকে অভিযোগ জানাতে পারেন।\nআমার কৃষক ভাই-বোনেরা, অন্যদের তো গরমের ছুটি মানে বিশ্রামের সময়। কিন্তু কৃষকের জন্য এটা আরও ঘাম ঝরাবার মরশুম। তাঁরা বর্ষার জন্য অপেক্ষা করেন এবং বর্ষা আসার আগে নিজের ক্ষেতটিকে তৈরি করার জন্য প্রাণপণে চেষ্টা শুরু করে দেন যাতে বর্ষার এক ফোঁটা জলও নষ্ট না হয়। কৃষকদের জন্য চাষ শুরুর আগের এই সময়টা খুব গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কিন্তু আমাদের দেশবাসীকেও ভাবতে হবে জল ছাড়া কীভাবে চলবে? আমরা আমাদের নিজ নিজ এলাকার পুকুর, জল আসার রাস্তা, পুকুরে জল ভরার পথ যদি নোংরা জঞ্জাল ফেলে বন্ধ করে রাখি, তবে জল আসা বন্ধ হয়ে জলের সঞ্চয় ক্রমশ কমে যাবে। আমরা কি ওইসব পুরনো জায়গাগুলো আবার একবার খুঁড়ে, পরিষ্কার করে রাখতে পারিনা, যাতে বেশি জল সঞ্চয় করা যায়? যতটা জল বাঁচানো যাবে ততটাই লাভ। প্রথম বর্ষণে যদি জল বাঁচানো যায়, তবে পুকুর ভরে থাকবে, নদী-নালা ভরে থাকবে এবং পরে বৃষ্টি কম হলেও আমাদের ক্ষতি কম হবে। এবার আপনারা হয়তো দেখেছেন, ৫ লাখ পুকুর এবং চাষ জমির পুকুর বানানোর প্রয়াস নেওয়া হয়েছে। ‘মনরেগা’ প্রকল্পের আওতায় জল সংরক্ষণের মাধ্যমে সম্পদ সৃষ্টিতে জোর দেওয়া হয়েছে।\nগ্রামে-গ্রামে জল বাঁচানো, আসন্ন বৃষ্টির প্রত্যেক ফোঁটা কী করে সংরক্ষণ করা যায়, গ্রামের জল গ্রামেই থাকুক – এই সব সচেতনতার অভিযান কীভাবে শুরু করা যায়, তার পরিকল্পনা আপনারা তৈরি করুন। এই সম্বন্ধীয় বিভিন্ন সরকারী যোজনায় আপনারা সামিল হোন, যাতে জলের গুরুত্ব এবং সংরক্ষণের জন্য সবাইকে নিয়ে এক জন-আন্দোলন গড়ে ওঠে। দেশের মধ্যে এমন অনেক গ্রাম আছে, অনেক প্রগতিশীল কৃষক রয়েছেন, অনেক সচেতন নাগরিক রয়েছেন, যাঁরা এই কাজ করছেন। কিন্তু আমাদের আরও এগিয়ে যেতে হবে।\nআমার কৃষক ভাই-বোনেরা, আমি আপনাদের আরও একটা কথা বলতে চাই। কিছুদিন আগে ভারত সরকার এক বড় কৃষি মেলার আয়োজন করেছিল। তাতে আমি দেখেছি, কত রকমের আধুনিক প্রযুক্তি এসেছে আর তা কৃষিকাজে কত পরিবর্তন এনে দিয়েছে। কিন্তু এই প্রযুক্তিগুলিকে এখন কৃষকের ক্ষেত পর্যন্ত পৌঁছতে হবে। আর এখন কৃষকরাও বলছেন, রাসায়নিক সারের ব্যবহার কমাতে হবে। আমি এই মতকে অভিনন্দন জানাচ্ছি। রাসায়নিক সারের অত্যধিক ব্যবহার আমাদের ধরিত্রী মাকে অসুস্থ করে দিয়েছে। আমরা ধরিত্রী মায়ের সন্তান। আমরা আমাদের ধরিত্রী মাকে অসুস্থ রাখতে চাই না। ভালো মশলা যদি রান্নায় দেওয়া হয়, তো রান্না ভাল হয়। কিন্তু ভাল ভাল মশলা যদি বেশি মাত্রায় দেওয়া হয়, তাহলে সেটা খেতে কি ভালো লাগে? সেটা খেতে নিশ্চয়ই ভাল লাগে না! রাসায়নিক সারের ব্যবহারও ঠিক এই রকম। যত ভাল সার-ই হোক না কেন, অতিরিক্ত এইসব সারের ব্যবহার ক্ষতির কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়াবে। প্রত্যেক জিনিষের ব্যবহার প্রয়োজনমত হওয়া দরকার। এতে খরচাও কম হয়, পয়সাও বাঁচে। আমি তো ভাবি, কম cost – বেশি output – কম খরচে বেশি উৎপাদন – এই নীতি নিয়ে আমাদের চলতে হবে। বৈজ্ঞানিক পদ্ধতির সঙ্গে আমাদের কৃষিকাজকে এগিয়ে নিয়ে যেতে হবে। বর্ষাকাল আসতে এখনও ১-২ মাস বাকি। আমি আশা করছি, জল সংরক্ষণের জন্য যেসব আবশ্যক কাজ রয়েছে, এরই মধ্যে পুরো মনোযোগ দিয়ে এই কাজটি সম্পূর্ণ করতে পারব। যত জল বাঁচবে, কৃষকদের ততটাই লাভ হবে আর জীবনও ঠিক ততটাই বাঁচবে।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, ৭-ই এপ্রিল হল ‘বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য দিবস’। এই বছর পৃথিবীতে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য দিবসের থিম হল – ‘বিট ডায়াবেটিস’। অর্থাৎ ডায়াবেটিসকে পরাস্ত করুন। ডায়াবেটিস এমন একটা রোগ, যেটা অন্যান্য সব রোগকেও ডেকে নিয়ে আসে। একবার যদি কারও ডায়াবেটিস হয়, তারপর অনেক রোগরূপী অতিথি নিজের ঘরে, শরীরে প্রবেশ করে। পরিসংখ্যান অনুযায়ী, ২০১৪ সালে আমাদের দেশে সাড়ে ৬ কোটি ডায়াবেটিসের রোগী ছিলেন। তিন শতাংশ মৃত্যুর কারণ হল ডায়াবেটিস। ডায়াবেটিস দুই রকমের – টাইপ 1 ও টাইপ 2। টাইপ 1 হল বংশগত, মা-বাবার থাকলে, সন্তানদের হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা থাকে। আর টাইপ-2-র কারণ হল বদভ্যাস, বয়সজনিত এবং অতিরিক্ত ওজন। আমরা এদের নিমন্ত্রণ করে ডেকে নিয়ে আসি।\nসমগ্র পৃথিবী ডায়াবেটিস নিয়ে চিন্তিত। এই জন্য ৭ তারিখ, বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য দিবসের থিম হল ডায়াবেটিস। আমরা সবাই জানি, ডায়াবেটিস-এর সবথেকে বড় কারণ হল আমাদের\nলাইফ-স্টাইল। কায়িক পরিশ্রম কম হচ্ছে। ঘামের কোনও নাম-গন্ধ নেই। হাঁটাচলা হচ্ছে না। খেলাও আমরা অনলাইনে খেলছি। অফলাইন-এ কিছু হচ্ছে না। আমরা কি ৭ তারিখের অনুপ্রেরণা নিয়ে ডায়াবেটিস-কে পরাস্ত করার জন্য নিজস্ব জীবনশৈলিতে কিছু পরিবর্তন আনতে পারি না? যদি আপনি যোগব্যায়ামে রুচি রাখেন, তাহলে যোগাভ্যাস করুন। না হলে অন্তত কিছু দৌড়-ঝাঁপ করুন। যদি আমাদের দেশের প্রত্যেক নাগরিক সুস্থ হয়, তাহলে আমাদের ভারত সুস্থ থাকবে। কখনও কখনও আমরা সঙ্কোচবশত মেডিক্যাল চেক-আপ করাই না। আর তারপর যখন অবস্থা খুব সঙ্কটজনক হয়, তখন আমাদের মনে আসে যে আমরা ডায়াবেটিস-এর পুরনো রোগী। পরীক্ষা করতে তো কোনও কষ্ট নেই! এইটুকু তো করতেই পারেন। আর এখন তো সমস্ত সুযোগ-সুবিধা হাতের কাছেই, অনেক সহজেই হয়ে যায়। আপনি নিশ্চয়ই বিষয়টি নিয়ে ভাববেন।\nগত ২৪-শে মার্চ পৃথিবীতে ‘যক্ষ্মা দিবস’ পালিত হল। যখন আমি ছোটো ছিলাম, তখন যক্ষ্মার নাম শুনলেই ভয় পেতাম। ভাবতাম যে, মৃত্যু একেবারে শিয়রে। কিন্তু এখন যক্ষ্মা ভয়ের কারণ নয়। কারণ, এখন সবাই জানে যে, যক্ষ্মার চিকিৎসা সম্ভব ও খুব সহজেই তাকে সারানো যায়। কিন্তু যখন যক্ষ্মা মৃত্যুর কারণ ছিল, তখন আমরা ভয় পেতাম। কিন্তু এখন আমরা যক্ষ্মার পরোয়া করি না। সমগ্র পৃথিবীর তুলনায় আমাদের দেশে যক্ষ্মা রোগীর সংখ্যা অনেক বেশি। যক্ষ্মা থেকে যদি মুক্তি পেতে হয়, তাহলে সঠিক চিকিৎসার দরকার এবং সার্বিক চিকিৎসার দরকার। আমাদের সঠিক ও সম্পূর্ণ চিকিৎসা প্রয়োজন। চিকিৎসা মাঝখানে ছেড়ে দিলে, নতুন সমস্যার সৃষ্টি হয়। যক্ষ্মা তো এমন একটা রোগ, যেটা আশেপাশের সবাই জানে, তাঁরাও চেক-আপ করার জন্য পরামর্শ দিতে পারেন। যদি কাশি হয়, জ্বর থাকে, ওজন কমতে থাকে, তাহলে আশেপাশের লোকেরও সন্দেহ হতে পারে যে, ব্যক্তিটির যক্ষ্মা হয়েছে কিনা। এর মানে হল, এটি এমন একটা রোগ যার তাড়াতাড়ি পরীক্ষা দরকার।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, এই বিষয়ে অনেক কাজ চলছে। ১৩,৫০০-র বেশি মাইক্রোস্কোপি সেন্টার রয়েছে। চার লাখেরও বেশি DOTs provider রয়েছে। অনেক আধুনিক পরীক্ষাগার রয়েছে আর, এসমস্ত পরিষেবা বিনামূল্যে পাওয়া যায়। আপনি একবার পরীক্ষা তো করান আর এই রোগ থেকে মুক্তি পেতে পারেন। সঠিক চিকিৎসা করুন এবং রোগ নির্মূল না হওয়া পর্যন্ত চিকিৎসা চালিয়ে যান। আমি আপনাদের অনুরোধ করব, যক্ষ্মা হোক বা ডায়াবেটিস – এদের আমাদের পরাস্ত করতে হবে। ভারতকে এই রোগগুলি থেকে মুক্ত করতে হবে। কিন্তু এটা কেবল সরকার, ডাক্তার, ওষুধ দিয়ে হবে না – যতক্ষণ না আপনারা এগিয়ে আসেন। আর এই জন্য আমি আজ দেশবাসীদের অনুরোধ করছি, আসুন, ডায়াবেটিস-কে পরাস্ত করুন এবং যক্ষ্মা থেকে মুক্তি পান।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, এপ্রিল মাসে অনেক গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিন আসছে। বিশেষ করে ১৪-ই এপ্রিল বাবাসাহেব ভীমরাও অম্বেদকর-এর জন্মদিন। ওঁর ১২৫-তম জন্ম-জয়ন্তী ধুমধামের সঙ্গে সারা দেশে পালিত হল। পঞ্চতীর্থের একটি ‘মহু’ ওঁর জন্মস্থান। লণ্ডনে ওনার পড়াশোনা। নাগপুরে দীক্ষা। ২৬, আলিপুর রোড, দিল্লি-তে ওঁর মহাপরিনির্বাণ হয়েছিল এবং মুম্বইতে যেখানে ওঁর শেষকৃত্য হয়েছিল সেই পূণ্যস্থল – এই পাঁচ তীর্থের উন্নতির জন্য আমরা নিরন্তর চেষ্টা করছি। আমার সৌভাগ্য যে, এই বছর ১৪-ই এপ্রিল পূজনীয় বাবাসাহেব আম্বেদকর-এর জন্মস্থান মহু যাওয়ার সৌভাগ্য হবে। দেশের দায়িত্ববান নাগরিক হওয়ার জন্য বাবাসাহেব আমাদের অনেক কিছু দিয়েছেন। সেই পথ অনুসরণ করে দেশের দায়িত্ববান নাগরিক হয়ে ওঁকে আমরা সবথেকে বড় শ্রদ্ধাঞ্জলি দিতে পারি। কিছুদিন পরে, বিক্রম অব্দ শুরু হচ্ছে। নতুন বিক্রম অব্দ আসবে। বিভিন্ন রাজ্যে, বিভিন্ন নামে এই উৎসব পালিত হয়। কেউ এটাকে ‘নব সম্বৎসর’ বলে, কেউ ‘গুড়ি-পর্বা’, কেউ ‘বর্ষ প্রতিপদা’, আবার কেউ ‘উগাদী’ বলে। কিন্তু ভারতবর্ষের প্রায় সমস্ত জায়গায় এটি পালিত হয়। নববর্ষের জন্য সবাইকে আমার অনেক অনেক অভিনন্দন।\nআপনারা জানেন, আমি গতবার বলেছিলাম যে, আমার ‘মন কি বাত’ অনুষ্ঠান প্রায় ২০টি ভাষায় আপনার সময় মতো যে কোনো সময় আপনার মোবাইল ফোনে শুনতে পারবেন। আপনাকে শুধু একটা মিসড কল করতে হবে। এই সুবিধা মাত্র একমাস হয়েছে, আর আমি খুশি হয়েছি যে, প্রায় ৩৫ লক্ষ মানুষ এর থেকে লাভবান হয়েছেন। আপনিও নম্বরটি লিখে নিন – 81908 81908। আমি আবার বলছি, 81908 81908। আপনি মিসড কল করুন, আর যখন আপনার সুবিধা হবে, আপনি পুরনো ‘মন কি বাত’ অনুষ্ঠানও আপনি আপনার মাতৃভাষায় শুনতে পাবেন। আমি খুশি হব, আপনার সঙ্গে যুক্ত হতে পেরে।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, আপনাদের সবাইকে অনেক অনেক অভিনন্দন! অনেক অনেক ধন্যবাদ!\nPG/SB\n"

        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga.

There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it.

Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call.

I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel.

Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

        "article": "\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो.. आपणा सर्वांना नमस्कार, आज जगभरातील ख्रिस्ती बांधव ईस्टरचा सण साजरा करीत आहेत. मी सर्वांना इस्टरच्या अनेक अनेक शुभेच्छा देतो.\nमाझ्या युवा मित्रांनो, आपण परीक्षेमध्ये व्यग्र असाल. काहींच्या परीक्षा झाल्या असतील. आणि काही जणांची दुहेरी परीक्षा असेल. कारण एकीकडे परीक्षा अभ्‍यास, आणि दुसरीकडे टी-20 क्रिकेट विश्वचषक स्पर्धा. आज आपण भारत आणि ऑस्ट्रेलिया यांच्यातील सामन्याची बहुधा प्रतिक्षा करत असाल. भारताने पाकिस्तान आणि बांग्लादेश यांच्याविरुध्द झालेले सामने जिंकले आहेत. आशादायक वातावरण तयार झाल्याचे दिसत आहे. आज ऑस्ट्रेलिया आणि भारत यांच्यात सामना होईल. दोन्ही संघातील खेळाडूंना मी शुभेच्छा देतो. आपल्या देशाची 65 टक्के लोकसंख्या तरुण आहे. क्रीडा जगतात आम्ही हरवून गेलो आहोत, हे काही मनाला पटत नाही. या क्रीडा जगतात नवीन क्रांती घडवण्याची वेळ आली आहे. आणि आपण बघतोय की भारतात क्रिकेट प्रमाणेच फुटबॉल, हॉकी, टेनिस, कबड्डी यासाठीही पोषक वातावरण तयार होत आहे.\nमाझ्या तरुण मित्रांना आज एक आनंदाची बातमी मी देणार आहे आणि त्याचबरोबर त्यांच्याकडून काही अपेक्षाही करणार आहे. तुम्हाला कदाचित हे कळले असेल की पुढील वर्षी 2017 मध्ये होणाऱ्या 17 वर्षाखालील एफआयएफए अर्थात फिफा म्हणजेच जागतिक फुटबॉल स्पर्धेचे यजमानपद भारताकडे आहे. जगभरातील 24 संघ भारतात खेळण्यासाठी येणार आहेत. 1951, आणि 1962 मध्ये झालेल्या आशियाई क्रीडा स्पर्धांमध्ये भारताने सुवर्णपदक जिंकले होते. आणि 1956 मध्ये झालेल्या ऑलिंपिक स्पर्धांमध्ये भारताला चौथे स्थान मिळाले. परंतु दुर्देवाने गेल्या काही दशकांमध्ये आपली कामगिरी घसरत गेली. आपण मागे पडलो, पिछाडीवर गेलो, मागेच राहिलो. आज फिफा मध्ये आपले स्थान कुठे आहे ? आपण कितव्या क्रमांकावर आहोत. हे सांगण्याचे धाडस मी करु शकत नाही. आणि त्याचवेळी दुसरीकडे मी बघतोय की युवा वर्गात फुटबॉलचे आकर्षण वाढत चालले आहे. ईपीएल असो, स्पॅनिश लिग असो, किंवा इंडियन सुपरलिगचे सामने असोत. या सामन्यांविषयी जाणून घेण्यासाठी, ते सामने दूरचित्रवाणीवर पाहण्यासाठी तरुण मित्र वेळ काढतात. सांगण्याचे तात्पर्य हे की फुटबॉलची आवड वाढत आहे. पण फुटबॉलचा हा महोत्सव आमच्या देशात होत असताना आम्ही केवळ यजमानपद भूषवून आपली जबाबदारी पार पाडावी का ? या पूर्ण वर्षभर सारे वातावरण फुटबॉलमय करु या. शाळांमध्ये, महाविद्यालयांमध्ये, हिंदुस्थानच्या कोपऱ्या कोपऱ्यात आमचे युवक, शाळेतील बालके घामाने चिंब भिजले आहे आणि फुटबॉल खेळला जात आहे. सर्वत्र असे वातावरण निर्माण करुया. आणि असे केले तर यजमानपदाचा आनंद अधिक वाढेल आणि म्हणून फुटबॉल गावा-गावात, प्रत्येक गल्लीत कसा पोहचवता येईल ? यासाठी प्रयत्न करु या.\n“2017 फिफा अन्डर 17” विश्वचषक ही यासाठी मला एक संधी आहे. या वर्षभरात सर्वत्र तरुणांमध्ये फुटबॉलविषयी नवा जोम, नवा जोश, नवा उत्साह आपण निर्मााण करुया. हे यजमानपद भारताकडे आल्याचा एक फायदा निश्चितच होणार आहे. आमच्या देशाला त्यासाठी लागणाऱ्या सोयी सुविधा तयार होतील. खेळासाठी आवश्यक असणाऱ्या गोष्टींकडे लक्ष दिले जाईल. आपल्या देशातील प्रत्येक तरुण जेव्हा फुटबॉलशी जोडला जाईल तेव्हा मला याचा खरा आनंद होईल.\nमित्रहो, आपल्याकडून मला एक अपेक्षा आहे. 2017 चे हे यजमानपद आपण कशा प्रकारे भूषवतो ? वर्षभर फुटबॉलचे वातावरण असावे यासाठी काय करता येईल ? फुटबॉलचा प्रचार कसा करावा ? सोयीसुविधांमध्ये सुधारणा कशा करता येईल ? या विश्वचषकामुळे, भारतातील तरुणांमध्ये खेळाविषयी आवड कशी वाढवता येईल ? शासन, शैक्षणिक संस्था, सामाजिक संघटना यांच्यात खेळाशी स्वत:ला जोडून घेण्याची स्पर्धा कशी उभी राहिल ?\nक्रिकेटच्या बाबतीत हे सर्व झाल्याचे आपण पाहतो. पण हेच वातावरण इतर खेळांच्या बाबतीतही आपल्याला तयार करायचे आहे. फुटबॉल एक संधी आहे. आपण मला आपल्‍या सूचना पाठवाल का ? तुमचे याबद्दलचे विचार पोहचवाल का ? जगभरात भारताचे Branding करण्यासाठी ही सुवर्णसंधी आहे असे मी मानतो. सामन्यात आपण काय कमावले ? काय गमावले ? अशा अर्थाने मला हे म्हणायचे नाही.\nया स्पर्धेच्या आयोजकपदाच्या निमित्ताने आपण आपल्यातील शक्ती एकत्र आणू शकतो, त्या शक्तीचे प्रकटीकरण करु शकतो आणि भारताचे Branding ही करु शकतो.\nयाबद्दलचे तुमचे विचार, तुमचे प्रस्ताव आपण मला नरेंद्र मोदी ॲपवर पाठवाल का ? या स्पर्धेचे बोधचिन्ह कसे असावे ? घोषवाक्य काय असावे ? भारतात हे सर्व कशाप्रकारे पोहचवता येईल ? स्पर्धेचे गीत कोणते असावे ? स्मृतीचिन्‍हाविषयी आपल्या मनात कोणती कल्पना आहे ?\nमित्रहो यावर विचार करा आणि माझी अशी इच्छा आहे की, माझ्या देशातील प्रत्येक तरुण या FIFA Under 17 विश्वचषक स्पर्धेचा सदिच्छादूत असेल. या आपणही यात सहभागी व्हा. भारताची ओळख करुन देण्यासाठी ही सुवर्णसंधी आहे.\nमाझ्या प्रिय विद्यार्थ्यांनो, या सुट्टीच्या दिवसांमध्ये फिरायला जाण्याविषयी, पर्यटनाविषयी आपण ठरवले असेलच. परदेशी जाणारे फार कमी, त्यांच्या तुलनेत आपल्याच राज्यांमध्ये पाच दिवस, सात दिवस अशा कालावधीसाठी बरेच जण जातात. काही विद्यार्थी दुसऱ्या राज्यांमध्येही जातात.\nआपण पर्यटनासाठी जिथे जाल तिथून छायाचित्र म्हणजेच Photo मला पाठवा, Upload करा असे मी आपल्याला मागच्यावेळी आवर्जुन सांगितले होते. आणि माझ्या लक्षात आले की, आपण जे काम आमच्या पर्यटन विभागाला जमले नाही, आमच्या सांस्कृतिक विभागाला शक्य झाले नाही, जे राज्य सरकारे करु शकली नाहीत आणि भारत सरकारलाही करता आले नाही, ते काम देशातील कोटयावधी पर्यटकांनी केले. त्यांनी अशा काही स्थळांची छायाचित्रे पाठवली, Photo Upload केले की ते बघताना खरोखर आनंद होतो.\nहे कार्य आता आपल्याला पुढे न्यायाचे आहे. याहीवेळी अशी छायाचित्रे पाठवा. पण त्याचबरोबर काही लिहून पाठवा. केवळ छायाचित्र पाठवू नका, आपल्यातील सर्जनशीलतेच्या प्रकटीकरणाला वाव दया, नवनव्या ठिकाणांना भेटी दिल्यामुळे, वेगवेगळया ठिकाणी गेल्यामुळे खूप शिकायला मिळते. ज्या गोष्टी शाळेच्या वर्गात आपण शिकू शकत नाही, आपल्या कुटुंबात आपल्याला शिकायला मिळत नाहीत आणि ज्या गोष्टी आपल्या मित्र-मंडळींमध्ये सुध्दा शिकायची संधी आपल्याला मिळत नाही अशा गोष्टी बऱ्याचदा पर्यटनातून जाणून घेण्याची, शिकण्याची सुसंधी आपल्याला मिळते. नवनव्या ठिकाणांचा नवेपणा, अनुभवता येतो. लोक, भाषा, खाद्यपदार्थ, तिथल्या चालीरिती, अशा अनेक गोष्टी पहायला मिळतात. आणि कुणीसे म्हटलेच आहे ‘A traveller without observation. is a bird without wings’निरीक्षण, अवलोकन याचा अभाव असणारा पर्यटक म्हणजे जणू पंखहीन पक्षीच होय. “शौक-ए-दीदार है अगर, तो नजर पैदा कर” काही बघण्याची आस मनात असेल तर ते बघण्याची दृष्टी आधी निर्माण करुया. भारत विविधतेने भरला आहे. तो पाहण्यासाठी एकदा बाहेर पडा, आयुष्यभर बघत रहाल, पहात रहाल, मन कधी भरणारच नाही. आणि याबाबतीत मी सुदैवी आहे. अनेक ठिकाणी जाण्याची, फिरण्याची संधी मला मिळाली.\nजेव्हा मी मुख्यमंत्री नव्हतो, पंतप्रधान नव्हतो, तेव्हा आपल्याप्रमाणेच बालवयात मी खूप फिरलो. कदाचित हिंदुस्थानात असा एकही जिल्हा नसेल की जिथे मी गेलो नाही.\nआयुष्य घडविण्यासाठी मोठे बळ मिळते. या प्रवासातून आणि आता भारतीय तरुणांमध्ये धाडसी पर्यटनाची आवड वाढू लागली आहे. नवे जाणून घेण्याची ओढ निर्माण होऊ लागली आहे. त्याच त्या, जुन्या मळलेल्या वाटा सोडून, काही नवीन करण्याची नवीन बघण्याची आकांक्षा त्यांच्या मनात आहे. हे चांगले लक्षण आहे असे मी मानतो. आमचे तरुण धाडसी वृत्तीचे असावेत. ज्याजागी यापूर्वी कुणीही गेले नाही, त्याजागी पोहचण्याची त्यांची इच्छा असावी.\nकोल इंडियाचे मी विशेष अभिनंदन करतो. वेस्टर्न कोल फिल्डस्‌ लिमिटेड, नागपूरजवळचे सावनेर ठिकाण, येथे कोळशाच्या खाणी आहेत. या कोळशाच्या खाणींपासून दूरच रहावे असे आमचे एक सर्वसाधारण मत असते. खाणीत काम करणाऱ्यांची छायाचित्र बघितल्यावर मनात प्रश्न येतोच की तिथे कसे वातावरण असेल ? आणि “कोळशाने हात झाले काळे, जग दूर पळे” अशा अर्थाची एक म्हणसुध्दा आहे.\nपण याच कोळशाला, कोळशाच्या खाणीला या मंडळींनी पर्यटन क्षेत्र बनवले आहे. नुकतीच सुरुवात झाली आहे. आणि जवळ जवळ दहा हजार नागरिकांनी नागपूरजवळच्या सावनेरच्या कोळसा खाणीला पर्यटक म्हणून भेट दिली आहे याचा मला आनंद होत वाटतो.\nया सुट्टयांमध्ये आपण फिरायला जाल, प्रवासाला जाल, तेव्हा स्वच्छता मोहिमेत आपला वाटा उचलाल अशी मी आशा करतो. हल्ली एक गोष्ट लक्षात येते, प्रमाण कमी असेल, त्यावर टीका करायचली असेल तर संधी आहे पण स्वच्छतेच्या बाबतीत लोकांमध्ये जागरुकता निर्माण होत आहे. पर्यटन स्थळांच्या ठिकाणी स्वच्छता असेल यासाठी प्रयत्न होतांना दिसतात. पर्यटक आणि पर्यटनस्थळी राहणारे अशा दोघांकडूनही काही प्रयत्न होतांना दिसत आहेत. सगळेच प्रयत्न अगदी शास्त्रशुध्द पध्दतीचे नसतीलही पण होत मात्र आहेत. या नात्याने आपणही विशेष लक्ष दयाल का ? मला खात्री आहे, या कामात माझे तरुण मित्र मला नक्की मदत करतील. आणि हे खरे आहे पर्यटन क्षेत्र हे सर्वाधिक रोजगार मिळवून देणारे क्षेत्र आहे. गरीबातील गरीब व्यक्तीसुध्दा कमावू शकते. जेव्हा पर्यटनस्थळी लोक जातात तेव्हा ते काहीना काही खरेदी करतात, खर्च करतात. तो गरीब असेल तरीही काहीतरी घेईल, तो श्रीमंत असेल तर तो अधिक खर्च करेल. पर्यटन क्षेत्राच्या माध्यमातून विपुल रोजगार निर्मिती शक्य आहे. पर्यटनाच्या बाबतीत जगाच्या तुलनेत भारत खूप मागे आहे. पण जर आपण सव्वाशे कोटी भारतीयांनी पर्यटन क्षेत्रावर जोर दयायचे ठरवले तर जगाला आपण भारताकडे आकर्षित करु शकतो. जगभराच्या पर्यटन क्षेत्रातील मोठा हिस्सा आपल्या देशाकडे आकर्षित करुन आमच्या देशातील कोटयावधी युवकांना रोजगार संधी निर्माण करुन देऊ शकतो. शासन असो, संस्था असोत, समाज असो वा नागरिक, आपण सगळयांनी मिळून हे काम करायचे आहे. या, हे करण्याच्या दिशेने प्रयत्न करुया.\nमाझ्या तरुण मित्रांनो, सुट्टया आल्या आणि अशाच गेल्या हे काही मला योग्य वाटत नाही. आपणही याबद्दल विचार करा. आपल्‍या सुट्टया आयुष्यातील महत्त्वाचे वर्ष आणि त्यातला बहुमूल्य वेळ असाच जाऊ दयायचा का ? विचार करण्यासाठी एक मुद्दा मी आपल्यासमोर मांडतो. या सुट्टयांमध्ये एखादी नवी कला, एखाद्ये कौशल्य आपल्या व्यक्तिमत्वात एखाद्या नव्या गोष्टीच्या प्राप्तीसाठी आपण संकल्‍प कराल का ? तुम्हाला पोहता येत नसेल तर या सुट्टयांमध्ये पोहायला शिकायचे तुम्ही ठरवा. सायकल चालवता येत नसेल तर या सुट्टयांमध्ये सायकल चालवता येत नसेल तर या सुट्टयांमध्ये सायकल शिका. आजही संगणकावर कंप्युटरवर टायपिंग करताना मी दोन बोटांनी करतो, मी सफाईदार टायपिंग करायला का शिकू नये ? आपल्या व्यक्तिमत्व विकासासाठी अनेक कौशल्याचा गोष्टी आहेत. त्या आपण का शिकू नयेत ? आपल्यातील त्रुटी का दूर करु नयेत ? आपले बळ का वाढवू नये ? जरा विचार करा.\nआणि हे सगळे करण्यासाठी मोठमोठे प्रशिक्षण वर्ग हवेत, प्रशिक्षक हवेत, भरमसाठ शुल्क हवे, खर्चाची मोठी तयारी हवी अशातला भाग नाहीये. आपल्या आजूबाजूला, समजा आपण ठरवले की मी कचऱ्यातून कला निर्माण करीन, टाकाऊतून टिकाऊ बनवीन तर ते करायला सुरुवात करा. त्यातून आपल्याला आनंद मिळेल. संध्याकाळ होईपर्यंत बघा, त्या कचऱ्यातून तुम्ही काय निर्माण केले आहे ? तुम्हाला चित्र रंगवायला आवडते ? पण येत नाही ? अरे मग सुरुवात तर करु, येईलच.\nव्यक्तिमत्व विकासासाठी, नवी कला शिकण्यासाठी, कौशल्य वाढण्यासाठी सुट्टीचा उपयोग अवश्य करा. अगणित क्षेत्र आहेत. मी सांगितलेल्या क्षेत्रांपेक्षाही अधिक संधी आहे. आपण जे क्षेत्र निवडाल, जे शिकाल त्‍यातून तुमच्या व्यक्तिमत्वाची ओळख होईल आणि त्यामुळे तुमचा आत्मविश्वास वाढेल. इतका वाढेल की तुम्ही बघाल सुट्टीनंतर शाळा सुरु झाल्यानंतर, महाविद्यालय सुरु झाल्यावर तुम्ही परत तिथे जाल आणि तुमच्या मित्राला सांगेल की दोस्ता, या सुट्टीत मी हे शिकलो.\nतो जर काहीच शिकला नसेल तर म्हणेल अरे. माझा वेळ वाया गेला. तू मात्र नवीन शिकून आलास. मित्रांमध्ये यावर आपसूक चर्चा होईल. तर या सुट्टयांमध्ये आपण काही नवीन कराल, नवीन शिकल आणि मला सांगाल असा मला भरवसा आहे. सांगाल ना ?\nयावेळी मन की बातमध्ये mygov वर अनेक सूचना आल्या आहेत.\nमाझे नाव अभी चतुर्वेदी आहे.\nनमस्कार, पंतप्रधान नरेंद्र मोदीजी. उन्हाळयाच्या मागच्या सुट्टीत आपण सांगितले होते की चिमण्यांनाही उन्हाळयाचा त्रास होतो त्यासाठी आपल्या बाल्कनीत किंवा गच्चीवर एका भांडयात पाणी भरुन चिमण्यांसाठी ठेवा. मी त्याप्रमाणे केले आणि मला सांगायला आनंद होतो की यामुळे चिमण्यांशी माझी मैत्रीच झाली. मन की बातमध्ये याबाबत तुम्ही पुन्हा एकदा सांगावे अशी माझी आपल्याला विनंती आहे.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, अभि चतुर्वेदी या मुलाचे मी आभार मानतो. त्याने फोन करुन मला एका चांगल्‍या कामाची आठवण करुन दिली. गेल्या वेळी माझ्या लक्षात होते आणि मी सांगितले होते की, उन्हाळयाच्या काळात पक्षांसाठी आपल्या दाराबाहेर मातीच्या भांडयात पाणी भरुन ठेवा. अभिने मला सांगितले की संपूर्ण वर्षभर तो हे करतोय आणि अनेक चिमण्यांशी त्याची मैत्री झाली आहे. हिंदी साहित्य क्षेत्रातील महान कवियत्री महादेवी वर्मा, पक्ष्यांवर त्यांचे खूप प्रेम होते. त्यांनी आपल्या कवितेत लिहिले होते. “तुझको दूर न जाने देंगे, दानों से आंगन भर देंगे और होद में भर देंगे हम मीठा-मीठा ठंडा पानी.” या महादेवीजींनी सांगितलेली ही गोष्ट आपणही करुया. एक अतिशय महत्त्वाचा मुद्दा लक्षात आणून दिल्याबद्दल अभिचे मी अभिनंदन करतो आणि आभारही मानतो.\nम्हैसूरच्या शिल्पा कुके यांनी एक संवेदनशील मुद्दा आपल्या सर्वांसमोर मांडला आहे. त्या म्हणतात. दूध विकणारे, वर्तमानपत्र विकणारे, पोस्टमन, आपल्या घरापाशी येतात. भांडी विकणारे, कपडे विकणारे घरासमोरुन जातात. उन्हाळयाच्या दिवसात यांना आपण कधी पाणी देऊ केले आहे का ?शिल्पा, मी आपले खूप खूप आभार मानतो. एका संवेदनशील विषयाला फार सोप्या पध्दतीने तुम्ही मांडले आहे. तुमचे म्हणणे बरोबर आहे. तसे पहायला गेले तर ही किरकोळ गोष्ट आहे. पण या कडाक्याच्या उन्हात आपल्या घरी येणाऱ्या पोस्टमनला आपण पाणी दिले तर त्यांना किती बरे वाटेल. असो, भारतात तर ही सवयच आहे. पण शिल्पा ही गोष्ट बारकाईने बघितल्याबद्दल मी आपले आभार मानतो.\nमाझ्या प्रिय शेतकरी बंधु-भगिनींनो, डिजिटल इंडिया – डिजिटल इंडिया असे आपण खूप ऐकले असेल. काही जणांना वाटते की डिजिटल इंडिया म्हणजे केवळ शहरातल्या युवकांचे जग आहे. पण असे नाही. आपल्याला ऐकून आनंद वाटेल की एक किसान सुविधा ॲप आपल्या सेवेसाठी तयार करण्यात आले आहे. आपल्या मोबाईल फोनमध्ये किसान सुविधा ॲप डाऊनलोड करुन घेतले तर त्याच्या माध्यमातून शेती, हवामान याविषयी बरीच माहिती अगदी सहज आपल्या हाती येईल. बाजारात काय चालले आहे ? भाजी मंडईत काय घडते आहे ? या दिवसात चांगल्या पिकाबद्दल काय माहिती उपलब्ध आहे ? कोणती औषधे उपयोगी आहेत ? अनेक विषय या ॲपवर आहेत. एवढेच नाही तर या ॲपमध्ये एक बटण असे आहे की त्‍याच्या माध्यमातून कृषिशास्त्रज्ञ, कृषीतज्ञ, यांच्याशी तुम्ही थेट संपर्क साधू शकता. तुमचा एखादा प्रश्न त्यांना विचारलात तर ते त्याचे उत्तर देतात, आपल्याला समजावून सांगात. माझे किसान बंधुभगिनी हे किसान सुविधा ॲप त्यांच्या मोबाईलवर डाऊनलोड करुन घेतील अशी मला आशा आहे. आणि एकदा वापरुन तर बघा. त्यात आपल्या उपयोगी पडणारे काय आहे? आणि तरीही काही उणिवा वाटल्या तर आपण माझ्याकडे त्याची तक्रार करा.\nमाझ्या शेतकरी बंधु भगिनींनो, इतरांसाठी उन्हाळा म्हणजे सुट्टीचा काळ. पण शेतकऱ्यांसाठी उन्हाळा म्हणजे घाम गाळण्याचा काळ. तो पावसाची प्रतिक्षा करतो. आणि प्रतिक्षेआधि जीव लावून शेताची मशागत करतो. जमीन तयार करतो जेणेकरुन पावसाचा एक थेंबही वाया जाणार नाही. शेतीचा प्रत्यक्ष हंगाम सुरु होण्यापूर्वीचा काळ शेतकऱ्यांसाठी फार महत्वाचा असतो. पण आम्हा देशवासियांनीही विचार केला पाहिजे की, पाण्यावाचून आपले काय होईल. तलाव, पाणी वाहून नेणारे नाले, तलावात पाणी येण्याचे मार्ग, जिथे काही कचरा साठला असेल, किंवा काही अतिक्रमण झाले असेल, तर पाणी येणे बंद आणि त्याचा परिणाम म्हणून जलसाठा हळूहळू कमी होत जातो. पाणी येण्याचे मार्ग, नाले, तलाव या काळात स्वच्छ करुन अधिक पाणी साठवण्यासाठी आपण प्रयत्न करुया का? जास्तीत जास्त पाणी वाचवू या. पहिल्याच पावसात पाणी वाचवले, तलाव भरले, नदी नाले भरले, तर नंतर जरी पाऊस पडला नाही, तर आपले कमी नुकसान होईल.\nयावेळी आपण बघितले असेल, पाच लाख शेततळी तयार करण्याचा निर्धार केला आहे. मनरेगाच्या माध्यमातून पाणी साठवण्यासाठी जलसंपत्ती तयार करण्यासाठी जोर देण्यात आला आहे. गावा-गावात पाणी वाचवू या. येणाऱ्या पावसाळ्यात पाण्याचा थेंब न थेंब कसा वाचवता येईल? गावातले पाणी गावातच कसे राहील? ही योजना कशी कार्यान्वित होईल? यावर विचार करा. आपण योजना तयार करा, शासकीय योजनेशी त्याचा मेळ घाला, जेणेकरुन एक असे जनआंदोलन उभे राहील, ज्यातून पाण्याचे महत्व सर्वांना पटेल आणि पाणी वाचवण्याच्या प्रयत्नात सगळे सहभागी होतील. देशभरात अशी कितीतरी गावं असतील, कितीतरी प्रगतीशील शेतकरी असतील, कितीतरी जागरुक नागरिक असतील, ज्यांनी हे काम केले असेल. पण तरीही आज आणखी काम करण्याची गरज आहे.\nमाझ्या शेतकरी बंधु भगिनींनो, एक गोष्ट आज मी आपल्याला पुन्हा सांगणार आहे. भारत सरकारने नुकतेच एक शेतीविषयक भव्य प्रदर्शन आयोजित केले होते. त्यात मी पाहिले की कसे आधुनिक तंत्रज्ञान शेतीत आले आहे. पण प्रत्यक्ष शेतापर्यंत ते पोचणे अजून बाकी आहे. खताचा वापर कमी करायला हवा, असे आता शेतकरीही म्हणून लागले आहेत. या विचाराचे मी स्वागत करतो. खतांच्या अतिरेकी वापरामुळे आपल्या भूमातेला आपण आजारी पाडले आहे. आपण या भूमातेचे पुत्र आहोत. ती आजारी पडणे आपण कसे बरे बघू शकू? उत्तम मसाल्यांचा वापर केला तर अन्नपदार्थ किती रुचकर होतो. पण उत्तमातले उत्तम मसाले बेसुमार वापरले तर तो अन्नपदार्थ खायची इच्छा होईल का? तेच जेवण आवडणार नाही. खतांचेही असेच आहे. ती खते कितीही उत्तम का असेना, गरजेपेक्षा अधिक वापरली तर ते विनाशाचे कारण ठरेल. प्रत्येक गोष्ट संतुलीत असायला हवी. त्यामुळे खर्चातही बचत होईल. आपले पैसे वाचतील आणि आमचे म्हणणे आहे कमी खर्च अधिक उत्पादन, कमी गुंतवणूक अधिक उत्पन्न. या मंत्राचे आचरण करायला हवे, शास्त्रीय पद्धतीचा वापर करुन आपले कृषी क्षेत्र पुढे न्यायला हवे. पाणी वाचविण्यासाठी पाणी साठवण्यासाठी जी आवश्यक कामे आहेत ती आपल्या हाती असणाऱ्या एक-दोन महिन्यात आपण निर्धाराने पूर्ण कराल अशी मला आशा आहे. जितके पाणी वाचेल, तितका शेतकऱ्याला अधिक फायदा होईल. जीवन तितके अधिक वाचेल.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, सात एप्रिल हा जागतिक आरोग्य दिन आहे. मधुमेहावर विजय हे यंदाच्या जागतिक आरोग्य दिनाचे घोषवाक्य आहे. मधुमेहावर नियंत्रण मिळवणे ही मध्यवर्ती संकल्पना आहे. मधुमेह हा एक असा यजमान आहे जो इतर रोगांचे स्वागत करण्यासाठी आतुर असतो. एकदा हा मधुमेह आपल्या शरीरात घुसला की त्या पाठोपाठ अनेक आजार व्याधी आपल्या शरीरात आल्याच म्हणून समजा.\nअसे सांगितले जाते की, 2014 मधे भारतात मधुमेहाच्या रुग्णांची संस्था साडेसहा कोटी इतकी होती.\nमृत्यूच्या कारणांमधे 3 टक्के मृत्यूचे कारण मधुमेह असल्याचे आढळले. मधुमेहाचे दोन प्रकार आहेत. टाईप-1 आणि टाईप-2\nटाईप-1 मधुमेह वंशपरंपरागत आहे. आई-वडिलांकडून तो मुलांकडे जातो.\nटाईप-2 मधुमेहाची कारणे आहेत सवयी, वय, स्थूलपणा. या मधुमेहाला आपण जणू आमंत्रण देऊन बोलावतो. सारे जग मधुमेहामुळे चिंतीत आहे. म्हणूनच सात एप्रिल, जागतिक आरोग्य दिनानिमित्त मधुमेहावर विजय ही संकल्पना ठरवण्यात आली आहे. आपली जीवनशैली टाईप-2 मधुमेहाचे मुख्य कारण आहे हे आपण सारे जाणतो.\nशारिरीक श्रम कमी होऊ लागले आहेत. घामाचा थेंबही नाही. चालणे फिरणे बंद. खेळ खेळले तरी ONLINE, खेळले जातात. OFFLINE काहीच होत नाही. 7 तारखेपासून प्रेरणा घेऊन आपल्या जीवनात मधुमेहाला पराभूत करण्यासाठी काही करु शकतो का? आपल्याला योगासने आवडत असतील, तर योगासने करा. नाही तर किमान चालणे, धावणे हा व्यायाम तरी करा. जर माझ्या देशातला प्रत्येक नागरिक निरोगी असेल, तर माझा भारतही निरोगी असेल.\nआरोग्य विषयक तपासण्या करण्याचा आम्हाला कधी कधी संकोच वाटतो. आणि तब्येत फारच बिघडल्यावर लक्षात येते की, मधुमेहाने फार पूर्वीच आपल्या शरीरात शिरकाव केला आहे. तपासणी करायला काय जातय? किमान एवढे तरी करु. आता अनेक सोयीसुविधा उपलब्ध आहेत. तपासण्या सहज करता येतात. आपण त्याकडे लक्ष द्या.\n24 मार्च रोजी जगभर क्षयरोग निवारण दिन पाळला गेला. मी लहान होतो, तेव्हा क्षयरोग या नुसत्या नावानेही भिती वाटायचे, असे वाटायचे की “आता मरण आलेच”. पण आता क्षयरोगाची भिती वाटत नाही. कारण सर्वांना माहित आहे की क्षयरोगावर उपचार होतात आणि सहज होतात. कोणे एकेकाळी क्षयरोग म्हणजेच मृत्यू हे समीकरण होते, त्याकाळी आम्हाला त्याची भिती वाटत असे. पण आज क्षयरोगाच्या बाबतीत आम्ही निष्काळजी झाली आहोत. जगातल्या इतर देशांच्या तुलनेत भारतात क्षयरोग्यांनी संख्या अधिक आहे. क्षयरोगापासून सुटका करुन घ्यायची असेल, तर अचूक उपचार आवश्यक आहेत आणि आवश्यक आहेत पूर्ण उपचार. योग्य उपचार आणि पूर्ण उपचार. उपचार अर्धवट सोडून दिले तर नव्या संकटाला निमंत्रण मिळते. बरं, एखाद्याला क्षयरोग झाला आहे हे त्याच्या शेजाऱ्यांनाही सहज कळू शकते. अरे भाऊ तपासणी करुन घे, क्षयरोग झाला असेल. सतत खोकला येत असेल. ताप येत असेल, वजन कमी होत असेल, तर शेजारच्या लोकांनाही कळते की हा क्षयरोग तर नसेल? याचा अर्थ असा की हा असा आजार आहे, ज्याची त्वरीत तपासणी करता येणे शक्य आहे.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, याबद्दल आपल्याकडे खूप काम होत आहे. 13 हजार 500 पेक्षा अधिक मायक्रोस्कोपिक सेंटर्स कार्यरत आहेत. चार लाखापेक्षा अधिक DOT Provider आहेत. अनेक अत्याधुनिक प्रयोगशाळा, तपासणी केंद्र आहेत. तुम्ही एकदा तपासून तर घ्या. आणि या आजाराचे पूर्णपणे निर्मूलन करता येते.\nबस योग्य उपचार आणि आजार नष्ट होईपर्यंत पूर्ण उपचार करणे आवश्यक आहे. क्षयरोग असो किंवा मधुमेह, त्याचे पूर्ण उच्चाटन आपण करुया असे मी आपल्याला आवर्जून सांगेन. भारताची या आजारांपासून सुटका करायची आहे. पण केवळ शासन, डॉक्टर आणि औषधे यातून हे साध्य होणार नाही. आपला सक्रीय सहभाग आवश्यक आहे. आणि म्हणून मधुमेहावर विजय मिळवण्यासाठी क्षयरोगापासून मुक्ती मिळवण्यासाठी मी आपण सर्व देशवासियांना आग्रह करतो.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, एप्रिल महिन्यात अनेक महत्वाचे दिन विशेष आहेत. विशेषत: 14 एप्रिल डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर यांची जयंती. त्यांची एकशेपंचवीसावी जयंती साऱ्या देशभर साजरी केली गेली. एक पंचतीर्थ- महू येथील त्यांचे जन्मस्थळ. लंडन-जिथे त्यांनी उच्चशिक्षण घेतले, नागपूर- जिथे त्यांनी दीक्षा घेतली. 26 अलीपूर मार्ग दिल्ली जिथे त्यांचे महापरिनिर्वाण झाले आणि मुंबईत जिथे त्यांच्यावर प्रयत्न करत आहोत. यावर्षी 14 एप्रिल रोजी पूजनीय डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर यांच्या जन्मस्थळावर महू इथे जाण्याचे परमभाग्य मला मिळत आहे. एक उत्तम नागरिक होण्यासाठी बाबासाहेबांनी आपल्याला खूप काही दिले आहे. त्यांनी दाखवलेल्या मार्गाचे आचरण करुन, एक उत्तम नागरिक होऊन आपण त्यांना फार मोठी श्रद्धांजली अर्पण करु शकतो.\nगेल्या काही दिवसात, विक्रम संवत्सराला सुरुवात होईल, नवीन विक्रम संवत्सर येईल. वेगवेगळ्या राज्यांमध्ये ते वेगवेगळ्या पद्घतीने साजरे केले जाते. कुणी त्याला नव संवत्सर म्हणतात, कुणी गुढीपाडवा म्हणतात, कुणी वर्ष प्रतिपदा म्हणतात, तर कुणी उगादि म्हणतात. पण हिंदुस्तानातील जवळजवळ सर्वच प्रांतांमध्ये त्याचे महात्म्य आहे.\nनववर्षानिमित्त सर्वांना माझ्या अनेक अनेक शुभेच्छा.\nआपल्याला माहित आहे की, मागच्या वेळी मी आपल्याला “मन की बात” ऐकण्याविषयी कधीही ऐकण्याविषयी सांगितले होते. सुमारे 20 भाषांमधे आपण मन की बात ऐकू शकता. तुमच्या वेळेनुसार ऐकू शकता. आपल्या मोबाईल फोनवर ऐकू शकता. बस आपण फक्त एक मिस्ड कॉल द्यायचा आहे. आणि मला सांगायला आनंद वाटतो की या सेवेचा लाभ, ती सुरु होऊन जेमतेम महिना झालाय, पण 35 लाख नागरिकांनी त्याचा लाभ घेतला आहे. आपणही क्रमांक टिपून घ्या 81908-81908, मी पुन्हा सांगतो 81908-81908. आपण मिस्ड कॉल करा. तुमच्या सोयीनुसार करा.\nमन की बात चा आधीचा कार्यक्रम आपल्याला ऐकायचा असेल, तर ते ही आपण ऐकू शकता. आपल्या भाषेत ऐकू शकता. या माध्यमातून आपल्याबरोबर रहायला मला आनंद वाटेल.\nमाझ्या प्रिय देशवासियांनो, आपणा सर्वांना अनेक अनेक शुभेच्छा. अनेक अनेक धन्यवाद.\nB.Gokhale/M.Desai\n"

        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"

        "article": "\nMy Dear Fellow Citizens,\nLet me begin by wishing ‘Namaskar’ to all of you. Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter. I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides.

Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you?

        "article": "\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, உங்களுக்கு என்னுடைய பற்பல வணக்கங்கள். இன்று உலகம் முழுக்க கிறிஸ்தவ சமுதாயத்தைச் சேர்ந்த மக்கள் ஈஸ்டர் திருநாளைக் கொண்டாடிக் கொண்டிருப்பார்கள். நான் அனைவருக்கும் ஈஸ்டர் பண்டிகைக்கான நல் நல்வாழ்த்துக்களைத் தெரிவிக்கிறேன்.\nஎன் இளைய நண்பர்களே, நீங்கள் அனைவரும் ஒரு புறம் தேர்வில் முனைப்பாக இருப்பீர்கள். சிலரது தேர்வுகள் நிறைவடைந்திருக்கலாம். சிலருக்கு இது வேறு ஒரு புறம் சவாலாக அமையலாம், ஏனென்றால் ஒரு பக்கம் தேர்வு நடந்து கொண்டிருக்கும் வேளை, மறு புறத்தில் உலகக் கோப்பைக்கான டி 20 போட்டிகள் நடைபெற்றுக் கொண்டிருக்கின்றன. இன்றும் கூட நீங்கள் இந்தியா ஆஸ்திரேலியா ஆட்டத்தை எதிர்பார்த்துக் காத்துக் கொண்டிருப்பீர்கள். கடந்த நாட்களில் இந்தியா, பாகிஸ்தான் வங்காளதேசம் ஆகிய நாடுகளின் அணிகளுக்கு எதிரான ஆட்டத்தில் சிறப்பாக ஆடி வெற்றி பெற்றது. ஒரு அருமையான உத்வேகம் புலப்படுகிறது. இன்று இந்தியா ஆஸ்திரேலியாவுடன் ஆட இருக்கும் வேளையில், நான் இரு அணி வீரர்களுக்கும் என் நல் வாழ்த்துகளைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன்.\n65 சதவீதம் மக்கள் இளைஞர்களாக இருந்தும் விளையாட்டு உலகத்தில் நம்மால் முத்திரை பதிக்க முடியவில்லை என்பது சரியானதாகப் படவில்லை. விளையாட்டுத் துறையில் ஒரு புரட்சியை ஏற்படுத்த வேண்டிய நேரம் வந்து விட்டது. இப்போது கிரிக்கெட்டைப் போலவே இந்தியாவில், கால்பந்தாட்டம், ஹாக்கி, டென்னிஸ், கபடி ஆகிய ஆட்டங்களுக்கு சாதகமான ஒரு மனோநிலை உருவாகி வருகிறது. இளைஞர்களிடம் இன்று நான் ஒரு மகிழ்வான செய்தியைக் கூறும் அதே வேளையில், சில எதிர்பார்ப்புக்களையும் வெளிப்படுத்த விழைகிறேன். அடுத்த ஆண்டு 2017இல் இந்தியா FIFA Under-17 உலகக் கோப்பைப் போட்டியை நம் நாட்டில் நடத்தவிருக்கிறது என்பது உங்களுக்கு ஒரு வேளை தெரிந்திருக்கலாம். உலகின் 24 அணிகள் இந்தியாவில் விளையாட வருகின்றன. 1951, 1962 ஆசியப் போட்டிகளில் இந்தியா தங்கப் பதக்கம் வென்றது; 1956 ஒலிம்பிக் போட்டிகளில் இந்தியாவுக்கு 4வது இடம் கிடைத்தது. ஆனால் துரதிர்ஷ்டவசமாக கடந்த சில பத்தாண்டுகளில் நாம் தரவரிசையில் மிகத் தாழ்ந்த நிலைக்குத் தள்ளப்பட்டிருக்கிறோம். தொடர் வீழ்ச்சியைக் கண்டு வந்துள்ளோம். இன்றோ FIFA வின் தரவரிசையில் நமது நிலை எந்த அளவுக்கு வீழ்ச்சி கண்டிருக்கிறது என்றால், அதை வாய் விட்டுக் கூறக் கூட சங்கடமாக இருக்கிறது. EPL ஆகட்டும், Spanish League ஆகட்டும், இந்திய சூப்பர் லீக் ஆட்டங்கள் ஆகட்டும், இன்று இந்திய இளைஞர்களுக்கு கால்பந்தாட்டத்தின் மீதான ஆர்வம் அதிகரித்து வருவதை நான் இன்றைய கால கட்டத்தில் காண்கிறேன். இந்தியாவின் இளைஞர்கள் கால்பந்தாட்டம் பற்றி மேலும் தகவல்களைத் தெரிந்து கொள்ள தொலைக்காட்சிகளைப் பார்க்கிறார்கள். இதை எதற்குச் சொல்கிறேன் என்றால், கால் பந்தாட்டத்தின் மீதான ஆர்வம் அதிகரிக்கிறது என்பதை வலியுறுத்தத் தான். ஆனால் இத்தனை பெரிய வாய்ப்பு இந்தியாவின் கதவங்களைத் தட்டும் போது நாம் புரவலர்களாக மட்டும் இருந்து நம் கடமைகளை ஆற்றுவோமா? இல்லை, நாம் ஆண்டு முழுவதிலும் எங்கும் கால் பந்து எதிலும் கால்பந்து என்றதொரு சூழலை உருவாக்கலாம், பள்ளிகளில், கல்லூரிகளில், இந்தியாவில் மூலை முடுக்கெங்கிலும் இந்திய இளைஞர்கள், நமது பள்ளி மாணவர்கள் என அனைவரும் கால்பந்தாட்டம் ஆடி வியர்வையில் குளிக்கட்டும். நாலாபுறங்களிலும் கால்பந்தாட்டம் விளையாடப்படட்டும். இப்படி நாம் செய்தால், கால்பந்தாட்டப் போட்டிகளில் புரவலர்கள் என்ற சந்தோஷம் ஒரு புறம் நமக்கு ஏற்படும்; அதே சமயம் நாம் இந்த வாய்ப்பைப் பயன்படுத்திக் கொண்டு கால்பந்தாட்டத்தை ஒவ்வொரு கிராமத்துக்கும், ஒவ்வொரு தெருவுக்கும் கொண்டு செல்லும் முயற்ச்சிகளில் ஈடுபட முடியும்.\n2017 FIFA Under – 17 உலகக் கோப்பை என்பது எப்படிப்பட்ட ஒரு வாய்ப்பு என்றால், இந்த ஓராண்டில் நாம் நாலாபுறங்களிலும் இளைஞர்களுக்குள்ளே கால்பந்தாட்டம் தொடர்பான புத்துணர்வை, ஒரு புதிய உற்சாகத்தை நரப்ப முயல வேண்டும். இந்த ஆட்டங்களுக்கான புரவலர்களாக நாம் இருப்பதில் ஒரு சாதகமான அம்ஸம் இருக்கிறது, அதாவது கால்பந்தாட்டத்துக்கான கட்டமைப்பு வசதிகள் இதனை ஒட்டி ஏற்படுத்தப்படும். விளையாட்டுக்குத் தேவையான முக்கியமான வசதிகள் மீது கவனம் செலுத்தப்படும். ஒவ்வொரு இளைஞனும் கால்பந்தாட்டத்தோடு இணைக்கப்படும் போது தான் நான் முழுமையாக மகிழ முடியும்.\nநண்பர்களே, நான் உங்களிடம் ஒன்று எதிர்பார்க்கிறேன். 2017ஆம் ஆண்டு போட்டிகளின் புரவலர்களான நாம் எப்படி இந்த வாய்ப்பைப் பயன்படுத்திக் கொள்ள முடியும், ஆண்டு முழுவதும் நமது கால்பந்தாட்டத் துறையில் உத்வேகத்தை ஏற்படுத்த என்னென்ன திட்டங்களை செயல்படுத்த வேண்டும், இது பற்றிய தகவல்களை எப்படி பரவலாக்குவது, அமைப்புக்களில் மேம்பாட்டை எப்படிச் செய்ய வேண்டும், FIFA Under – 17 உலகக் கோப்பை வாயிலாக இந்திய இளைஞர்கள் மத்தியில் இந்த விளையாட்டின் பால் எப்படி ஆர்வத்தை அதிகரிக்கச் செய்வது, அரசுகளில், கல்வி நிறுவனங்களில், மற்ற சமூக அமைப்புக்களில் விளையாட்டை ஒட்டிய போட்டிகளை எவ்வாறு செயல்படுத்தலாம்? க்ரிக்கெட்டை நாம் அனைவரும் ஆர்வத்தோடு பார்க்கும் அதே வேளையில், இது போன்றதொரு நிலையை மற்ற விளையாட்டுக்களிலும் நாம் கொண்டு வர வேண்டும். கால்பந்தாட்டப் போட்டிகள் ஒரு நல் வாய்ப்பு. நீங்கள் இது தொடர்பான உங்கள் ஆலோசனைகளை எனக்கு அளிக்க முடியுமா? உலக அளவில் இந்தியாவை branding செய்ய இது ஒரு வாய்ப்பாக நான் கருதுகிறேன். இந்தியாவின் இளைஞர்கள் சக்தியை அடையாளம் காட்ட அமைந்த ஒரு நல் வாய்ப்பாக நான் இதைக் கருதுகிறேன். ஆட்டங்களில் நாம தோற்றோமா, ஜெயித்தோமா என்ற அர்த்தத்தில் நான் கூற வரவில்லை. இந்தப் பந்தயத்தை நடத்துவதன் வாயிலாக நாம் நமது ஆற்றலை முடுக்கி விட முடியும், சக்தியை வெளிப்படுத்த முடியும், அதே வேளையில் நாம் பாரதத்துக்கு brandingஐயும் செய்ய முடியும். நீங்கள் நரேந்திரமோதிAppஇல் இது தொடர்பான உங்கள் ஆலோசனைகளை எனக்கு அனுப்பி வைப்பீர்கள் இல்லையா? Logo எப்படி இருக்க வேண்டும், விளம்பர கோஷங்கள் / slogans எப்படி இருக்க வேண்டும், இந்தியா இதை விளம்பரப்படுத்த என்னென்ன வழிமுறைகளைப் பின்பற்ற வேண்டும், பாடல் எப்படி இருக்க வேண்டும், நினைவுப் பரிசுகள் செய்யப்பட வேண்டும் என்றால் எந்த வகையில் எல்லாம் அவை அமையலாம். உங்கள் எண்ணக் குதிரைகளைத் தட்டி விடுங்கள் தோழர்களே, எனது ஒவ்வொரு இளைஞரும் இந்த 2017 FIFA உலகக் கோப்பைக்கான தூதுவராக இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று நான் விரும்புகிறேன். நீங்களும் இதில் கலந்து கொள்ளுங்கள், இந்தியாவுக்கு ஒரு அடையாளத்தைப் படைக்க இது பொன்னான தருணம்.\nஎனதருமை மாணவச் செல்வங்களே, விடுமுறை நாட்களில் சுற்றுலா செல்லலாம் என்று நீங்கள் திட்டமிட்டிருப்பீர்கள். மிகக் குறைவான பேர்களே அயல்நாடுகளுக்குச் செல்கிறார்கள், பெரும்பாலானோர் அவரவர் மாநிலங்களில் 5 நாட்கள், 7 நாட்கள் என சுற்றுலா சென்று விடுகிறார்கள். சிலரோ தங்கள் மாநிலங்களை விட்டு வேறு மாநிலங்களுக்குச் செல்கிறார்கள். நீங்கள் எங்கு செல்கிறீர்களோ, அந்த இடத்தின் புகைப்படத்தை தரவேற்றம் செய்யுங்கள் என, கடந்த முறை கூட நான் உங்களிடம் வேண்டுகோள் ஒன்று வைத்திருந்தேன். எந்தப் பணியை சுற்றுலாத் துறையால் செய்ய முடியவில்லையோ, எந்தப் பணியை நமது கலாச்சாரத் துறையால் செய்ய முடியவில்லையோ, எந்தப் பணியை மாநில அரசுகள், இந்திய அரசு ஆகியவற்றால் செய்ய முடியவில்லையோ, அந்தப் பணியை நாட்டின் கோடிக்கணக்கான அயல்நாடு வாழ் மக்கள் செய்திருக்கிறார்கள். அவர்கள் தரவேற்றம் செய்திருக்கும் புகைப்படங்களை எல்லாம் பார்க்கும் போது, உண்மையிலேயே ஆனந்தம் மேலிடுகிறது. இந்தப் பணியை நாம் முன்னெடுத்துச் செல்ல வேண்டும், அதே போல இந்த முறையும் செய்யுங்கள், ஆனால் இந்த முறை வேறு ஒன்றையும் சேர்த்துச் செய்யுங்கள். வெறும் புகைப்படம் மட்டும் அனுப்பாமல், அதோடு உங்கள் படைப்பாற்றலையும் வெளிப்படுத்துங்கள், புது இடங்களுக்குச் செல்லும் போதும் பார்க்கும் போதும் பல விஷயங்கள் தெரிந்து கொள்ள முடிகிறது. எந்த விஷயங்களை நம்மால் வகுப்பறைகளில் கற்க முடிவதில்லையோ, எவற்றைக் குடும்பத்தில் கற்க முடிவதில்லையோ, எவற்றை நமது நண்பர்களிடத்திலும் கூட தெரிந்து கொள்ள முடிவதில்லையோ, அவற்றை எல்லாம் சில வேளைகளில் பயணிக்கும் போது நம்மால் அதிகம் கற்றுக் கொள்ள முடிகிறது, புதிய இடங்கள் ஒரு புதிய அனுபவத்தை நமக்குள் விதைக்கிறன. மக்கள், மொழி, உணவு, செல்லும் இடங்களில் நிலவும் வாழ்க்கை முறை என எத்தனை விஷயங்களைப் பார்க்க முடிகிறது. A traveler without observation is a bird without wings, அதாவது கவனித்தல் இல்லாத ஒரு பயணி சிறகில்லாத பறவைக்கு இணையானவர் என்று யாரோ கூறியது நினைவுக்கு வருகிறது. காட்சிகளைப் பார்க்கும் ஆர்வம் இருக்குமாயின், அதற்கு ஏற்ப கண்ணோட்டத்தை ஏற்படுத்திக் கொள்ளுங்கள். இந்தியா வேற்றுமைகள் நிறைந்த நாடு. ஒரு முறை காண வேண்டும் என்று பயணிக்கத் தொடங்கி விட்டால், வாழ்க்கை முழுவதும் பயணித்துக் கொண்டே தான் இருப்பீர்கள், பார்த்து ரசித்துக் கொண்டே தான் இருப்பீர்கள். உங்கள் மனம் எப்போதும் நிறையாது, அந்த வகையில் சுற்றுப் பயணம் செய்யும் நல்வாய்ப்பு எனக்குக் கிட்டியது நான் செய்த அதிர்ஷ்டம் தான்.\nநான் முதல்வராகவோ பிரதமராகவோ இல்லாத காலத்தில், நானும் உங்களை மாதிரியே சிறு வயதுடையவனாக இருந்த போது நிறைய சுற்றிப் பார்த்திருக்கிறேன். இந்தியாவில் நான் செல்லாத மாவட்டம் என்ற ஒன்று இருக்குமா என்பது சந்தேகம் தான். நம் வாழ்க்கையை உருவாக்குவதில் சுற்றுலாவுக்கு என மிகப் பெரிய சக்தி இருக்கிறது, இப்போதெல்லாம் இந்திய இளைஞர்கள் சுற்றுலா செல்ல அதிக ஆர்வம் காட்டுகிறார்கள், அவர்களின் உற்சாகம் அதிகரித்து வருகிறது. பழைய மாதிரி எல்லோரும் சென்ற, அல்லது அமைத்துக் கொடுத்த பாதையில் அவர்கள் பயணிப்பதில்லை, ஏதோ ஒன்றை புதியதாக செய்ய விரும்புகிறார்கள், ஏதோ ஒரு புதிய விஷயத்தைக் காண விரும்புகிறார்கள். நான் இதை ஒரு நல்ல அடையாளமாகக் கருதுகிறேன். நமது இளைஞர்கள் சாகசமானவர்களாக இருக்க வேண்டும், எங்கே யாரும் கால் பதிக்கவில்லையோ, அங்கே கால் பதித்து முன்னேறும் ஆர்வம் மிக்கவர்களாக இருக்க வேண்டும்.\nநான் coal india நிறுவனத்துக்கு என் சிறப்பான பாராட்டுதல்களைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன். Western coalfields limited, WCL நிறுவனத்துக்கு நாக்பூருக்கு அருகே சாவனேர் என்ற இடத்தில் நிலக்கரிச் சுரங்கங்கள் இருக்கின்றன. அந்த நிலக்கரிச் சுரங்கங்களை அவர்கள் Eco Friendly Mine Tourism Circuit, அதாவது சூழலுக்கு இசைவான சுற்றுலாச் சுற்றாக மேம்படுத்தி இருக்கிறார்கள். பொதுவாக நிலக்கரிச் சுரங்கங்களிடமிருந்து விலகியே இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று எண்ணுவோம். அங்கிருப்போர் பற்றிய படங்களைப் பார்க்கும் போது அங்கு சென்று என்ன ஆகப் போகிறது என எண்ணுவோம்; நிலக்கரியால் கைகளை கருப்பாக்கிக் கொண்டால் தாமாகவே மற்றவர்கள் விலகி ஓடுவார்கள் என்று எங்கள் பகுதியில் ஒரு வழக்கே கூட இருக்கிறது. ஆனால் அதே நிலக்கரியை வைத்தே சுற்றுலாச் சுற்று ஒன்றை ஏற்படுத்தல் என்பது மகிழ்வை அளிக்கிறது. இது ஒரு தொடக்கம் மட்டுமே, இது வரை சுமார் பத்தாயிரத்துக்கும் மேற்பட்டவர்கள் நாகபுரிக்கு அருகே உள்ள ஸாவனேர் கிராமத்துக்கு பக்கத்தில் அமைந்திருக்கும் சூழலுக்கு இசைவான நிலக்கரிச் சுரங்க சுற்றுலாவை அனுபவித்திருக்கிறார்கள். புதுமையான ஒன்றைக் காணும் வாய்ப்பை இது ஏற்படுத்திக் கொடுக்கிறது. இந்த விடுமுறைக் காலத்தில் நீங்கள் பிற இடங்களுக்குச் செல்லும் போது, தூய்மை தொடர்பாக உங்கள் பங்களிப்பை அளிக்க முடியுமா? இப்போதெல்லாம் ஒரு விஷயம் கண்டிப்பாக காண முடிகிறது, அளவு குறைவானதாக இருக்கலாம், விமர்சனம் செய்யும் அதே வேளையில், இது வாய்ப்பாகவும் இருக்கிறது, ஆனால் ஒரு புதிய விழிப்புணர்வை ஏற்படுத்தி இருக்கிறது என்பது என்னவோ உறுதி. சுற்றுலா இடங்களில் மக்கள் தூய்மையைக் கடைபிடிக்க வேண்டும் என்ற முயற்ச்சியில் ஈடுபடுகிறார்கள். சுற்றுலாப் பயணிகளும் இதை மேற்கொள்கிறார்கள், சுற்றுலா இடங்களில் வசிக்கும் மக்களும் தூய்மை தொடர்பான தங்கள் பங்களிப்பை அளிக்கிறார்கள். இது மிகவும் விஞ்ஞான பூர்வமாக செய்யப்படாமல் இருக்கலாம், ஆனால் நடப்பது என்னவோ உண்மை. நீங்களும் ஒரு சுற்றுலாப் பயணி என்ற முறையில் சுற்றுலா மையத்தில் தூய்மை என்ற கருத்துக்கு வலு கூட்டும் வகையில் செயல்பட முடியுமா? என்னுடைய இளைய நண்பர்கள் இந்தப் பணியில் எனக்கு கண்டிப்பாக உதவியாக இருப்பார்கள் என்ற நம்பிக்கை இருக்கிறது.\nசுற்றுலா என்பது அதிக வேலை வாய்ப்பை ஏற்படுத்தும் ஒரு துறை என்பது உண்மை. சுற்றுலா இடத்துக்கு வந்து விட்டால், பரம ஏழையால் கூட சம்பாதிக்க முடிகிறது. ஏழை சுற்றுலாப் பயணி சென்றாலும் கூட, ஏதோ ஒன்றை வாங்குகிறார். சுற்றுலாப் பயணி சீமானாக இருந்தால், அவர் அதிக செலவு செய்வார். உலகத்தோடு ஒப்பிட்டுப் பார்க்கையில் இந்தியாவில் சுற்றுலா என்பது மிகவும் பின் தங்கி இருக்கிறது. ஆனால் நமது சுற்றுலாத் துறையை பலப்படுத்த வேண்டும் என்று 125 கோடி மக்களும் ஒரு மனதோடு தீர்மானித்தால், உலகத்தையே நம்மால் கவர்ந்திழுக்க முடியும். உலகின் சுற்றுலாப் பயணிகளில் பெரும் பகுதியை நாம் நம்மை நோக்கி ஈர்க்க முடியும், நம் நாட்டின் கோடிக்கணக்கான இளைஞர்களுக்கு வேலை வாய்ப்பு ஏற்படுத்திக் கொடுக்க முடியும். அரசாகட்டும், அமைப்புக்களாகட்டும், சமுதாயமாகட்டும், குடிமக்களாகட்டும், நாமனைவரும் இணைந்து இந்தப் பணியில் ஈடுபடுவோம். வாருங்கள் நாம் இந்தத் திசையில் பயணிக்கும் முயற்ச்சியில் ஈடுபடுவோம்.\nஎனது இளைய நண்பர்களே, விடுமுறை நாட்கள் ஏதோ வந்தன, சென்றன என்ற நிலை எனக்குப் பிடிக்கவில்லை. நீங்களும் இந்தக் கண்ணோட்டத்தில் சிந்தியுங்கள். உங்கள் விடுமுறை நாட்கள், வாழ்க்கையின் மகத்துவமான ஆண்டுகள், அவற்றின் மகத்துவம் பொருந்திய கணங்களை வீணே செல்ல விடலாமா? நான் உங்கள் சிந்தைக்கு ஒரு கருத்தை முன்வைக்கிறேன். நீங்கள் உங்கள் விடுமுறைக் காலத்தில் ஒரு திறனை வளர்த்துக் கொள்ளலாம், உங்கள் ஆளுமைக்கு பெருமை சேர்க்கும் விதமாக ஒரு புதிய விஷயத்தை இணைத்துக் கொள்ளலாம் இல்லையா? உங்களுக்கு நீச்சல் தெரியாது என்றால், விடுமுறைக்காலத்தில் நான் நீச்சல் கற்றுக் கொள்வேன் என்றோ, சைக்கிள் ஓட்டத் தெரியாது என்றால், சைக்கிள் ஓட்டக் கற்றுக் கொள்வேன் என்றோ தீர்மானிக்கலாம். இன்றும் கூட நான் இரண்டு விரல்களைக் கொண்டு கணிப்பொறியில் டைப் செய்கிறேன் என்றால் நான் தட்டெழுத்துப் பயிற்ச்சியை மேற்கொள்ளலாமே? நம்முடைய ஆளுமையை வளர்த்துக் கொள்ள எத்தனை வகையான திறன்கள் இருக்கின்றன, இல்லையா? நாம் ஏன் அவற்றைக் கற்றுக் கொள்ள முடியாது? நாம் ஏன் நம் குறைபாடுகளை நீக்கிக் கொள்ளக் கூடாது? நாம் ஏன் நமது ஆற்றலை வளர்த்துக் கொள்ளக் கூடாது?\nஇப்போது சிந்தித்துப் பாருங்கள், இதற்க்கென பெரிய பயிற்ச்சிகள் தேவையில்லை, எந்த பயிற்சியாளரும் அவசியமில்லை, அதிக கட்டணம் தேவையில்லை, பெரிய செலவாகும் என்பதெல்லாம் இல்லை. உங்களுக்கு அருகே இருக்கும் ஒன்றைக் கூட, எடுத்துக்காட்டாக கழிவுப் பொருளிலிருந்து ஆக்கபூர்வமான பொருளை உருவாக்குவேன் என்று கூட நீங்கள் தீர்மானம் செய்து கொள்ளலாம். கவனித்துப் பாருங்கள், பிறகு நீங்களே செய்யத் தொடங்குங்கள். உங்களுக்கு மகிழ்ச்சி ஏற்படும், மாலை நெருங்கும் வேளையில் நீங்கள் பார்த்துக் கொண்டே இருக்கும் போதே, குப்பையிலிருந்து நீங்கள் கோபுரத்தை சமைத்திருப்பீர்கள். உங்களுக்கு படம் வரைய விருப்பமா, ஆனால் வரைய வராது என்றால், தொடங்குங்களேன், தானே வரும். விடுமுறைக் காலங்களில் உங்கள் ஆளுமையை வளர்த்துக் கொள்ள, உங்களிடம் ஒரு புதிய திறனை மேம்படுத்திக் கொள்ள, உங்கள் திறனை அதிகரித்துக் கொள்ள அவசியம் முயலுங்கள், எண்ணிறந்த துறைகளில் நீங்கள் இப்படிச் செய்ய முடியும், நான் சொல்லும் துறைகளில் மட்டுமே செய்ய வேண்டும் என்ற அவசியம் இல்லை. உங்கள் ஆளுமை அதன் மூலம் அடையாளம் காணப்படும், உங்களின் தன்னம்பிக்கை ஏராளமான அளவு அதிகரிக்கும். ஒரு முறை செய்து பாருங்கள், விடுமுறை நாட்களுக்குப் பிறகு நீங்கள் பள்ளிக்கோ, கல்லூரிக்கோ செல்லும் போது, நான் இந்த விடுமுறை நாட்களில் இதைக் கற்றுக் கொண்டேன் என்று கூறுவீர்கள், அந்த நண்பர் எதையும் கற்றுக் கொண்டிருக்க மாட்டார், அந்த நேரத்தில் நண்பா, என் விடுமுறைக் காலத்தை நான் வீணாக்கி விட்டேன், ஆனால் நீ நன்கு சிறப்பாக செயல்பட்டிருக்கிறாய் என்று கூறுவார். இது போல மற்ற நண்பர்களிடமும் உரையாடல் நிகழும். நீங்கள் கண்டிப்பாக இதைச் செய்வீர்கள் என்று நான் நம்புகிறேன். நீங்கள் புதியதாக எதைக் கற்றுக் கொண்டீர்கள் என்று என்னிடம் கூறுங்கள். கூறுவீர்கள் இல்லையா! இந்த முறை மனதின் குரலில், mygov தளத்தில் சில ஆலோசனைகள் வந்திருக்கின்றன.\nஎனது பெயர் அபி சதுர்வேதி. வணக்கம் பிரதமர் அவர்களே, நீங்கள் கடந்த கோடைக் கால விடுமுறையின் போது, பறவைகளுக்கும் கோடையின் வெப்பம் வாட்டும், ஆகையால் நாம் அவற்றுக்காக பால்கனியிலோ, வீட்டின் மாடியிலோ ஒரு பாத்திரத்தில் நீர் வைக்க வேண்டும், இதன் மூலம் அவற்றுக்கு நீர் கிடைக்கும் என்று கூறி இருந்தீர்கள். நான் இந்த வேலையைச் செய்த போது எனக்கு மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சியாக இருந்தது, இதன் வாயிலாக நிறைய பறவைகளோடு எனக்கு நட்பு மலர்ந்தது. இந்த முறை மீண்டும் இதை உங்கள் மனதின் குரலில் வெளிப்படுத்துங்கள் என்று வேண்டிக் கேட்டுக் கொள்கிறேன். நன்றி.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, நான் அபி சதுர்வேதி அவர்களுக்கு மிகவும் கடமைப் பட்டிருக்கிறேன். இந்தச் சிறுவன் நான் மறந்த ஒரு விஷயத்தை எனக்கு நினைவு படுத்தி இருக்கிறார். இதைப் பற்றிக் கூற வேண்டும் என்று என் மனதில் உதிக்கவில்லை, ஆனால் கடந்த ஆண்டு நான் பறவைகளுக்காக வீட்டுக்கு வெளியே மண் கலயத்தை வைக்க வேண்டும் என்று கேட்டுக் கொண்டதை அபி எனக்கு நினைவுபடுத்தியிருக்கிறார். எனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, நான் அபி சதுர்வேதி என்ற சிறுவனுக்கு என் நன்றிகளைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன். அவர் தொலைபேசியில் தொடர்பு கொண்டு ஒரு நல்ல செயலைப் பற்றி எனக்கு நினைவூட்டி இருக்கிறார். கடந்த முறை நான் கூறியது எனக்கு நினைவில் உள்ளது. வெப்பக் காலங்களில் உங்கள் வீட்டுக்கு வெளியே மண் பாத்திரங்களில் நீர் நிரப்பி வையுங்கள் என்று நான் கேட்டுக் கொண்டிருந்தேன். ஆண்டு முழுக்க அவர் இந்தப் பணியை செய்து வருவதாக அபி எனக்குத் தெரிவித்திருக்கிறார். இதன் மூலம் பல பறவைகள் அவருக்கு நேசமாகி இருப்பதாகவும் அவர் கூறியிருக்கிறார். ஹிந்தி இலக்கிய உலகின் மகத்தான கவிஞர்களில் ஒருவரான மகாதேவி வர்மா அவர்கள் பறவைகளின் மீது அளப்பரிய பாசம் கொண்டிருந்தார். அவர் தனது கவிதைகளில், உன்னை தொலைவாகச் செல்ல அனுமதிக்க மாட்டேன், தானியங்களால் முற்றத்தை நிரப்புவேன், எங்கும் குளிர்ந்த இன்சுவை நீரை நிறைத்து வைப்பேன், என்று பாடி இருக்கிறார். நான் அபிக்கு என் நல்வாழ்த்துக்களைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்வதோடு என் பாராட்டுதல்களையும் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன், நீங்கள் எனக்கு மிக முக்கியமான விஷயத்தை நினைவு படுத்தி இருக்கிறீர்கள்.\nமைசூரைச் சேர்ந்த ஷில்பா கூகே (Kooke) மிகவும் நுட்பமான ஒரு கருத்தை முன் வைத்திருக்கிறார். நமது இல்லங்களுக்கு அருகே பால் விற்பனை செய்ய வருகிறார்கள், செய்தித் தாள் விற்பவர்கள் வருகிறார்கள், தபால்காரர் வருகிறார், சில வேளைகளில் பாத்திர விற்பனையாளரோ, துணிமணி விற்பனை செய்பவரோ கடந்து செல்கிறார்கள். கோடையின் வெப்பம் தகிக்கும் வேளையில் அவர்களின் தாகம் தணிக்க நீர் வேண்டுமா என்று எப்போதாவது நாம் கேட்டிருக்கிறோமா? எப்போதாவது நாம் அவர்களுக்கு அருந்த நீர் அளித்திருக்கிறோமா? ஷில்பா, உங்களுக்கு என் நெஞ்சார்ந்த நன்றிகள், நீங்கள் மிகவும் உணர்வுரீதியான கருத்தை மிகவும் இயல்பான முறையில் முன் வைத்திருக்கிறீர்கள். விஷயம் என்னவோ சிறியது தான் என்றாலும் கோடைக்காலத்தின் போது ஒரு தபால்காரர் வீட்டினருகே வரும் போது, நாம் அவருக்கு அருந்த நீர் அளித்தால் அவருக்கு எத்தனை இதமாக இருக்கும். இந்தியாவில் இந்த மனோபாவம் இயல்பாகவே இருக்கிறது. ஆனால் நீங்கள் இத்தனை நுட்பமான விஷயத்தின் மீது கவனம் செலுத்தியிருப்பதைக் கண்டு நான் உங்களுக்கு நன்றிகளைத் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன்.\nஎனதருமை விவசாய சகோதர சகோதரிகளே, டிஜிட்டல் இந்தியா பற்றி நீங்கள் அதிகமாக கேள்விப்பட்டிருப்பீர்கள். சிலருக்கு இந்த டிஜிட்டல் இந்தியா என்பது ஏதோ நகரத்து இளைஞர்கள் தொடர்பான விஷயமாகப் படலாம். அது தான் இல்லை, உங்களுக்கு வசதியாக விவசாயிகள் வசதிக்கானApp ஒன்று சேவையில் அறிமுகப் படுத்தப்பட்டிருக்கிறது. இந்த விவசாயிகள் வசதிக்கானAppஐ நீங்கள் உங்கள் மொபைல் ஃபோனில் தரவிறக்கம் செய்து கொண்டால், விவசாயம் தொடர்பான, வானிலை தொடர்பான அனைத்துத் தகவல்களும் உங்கள் கைத்தலத்திலேயே கிடைத்து விடும். சந்தைகளில் நிலைமை என்ன, சந்தைக்கூடங்களில் நிலை என்ன, நல்ல அறுவடையின் போக்கு எப்படி இருக்கிறது, எந்த விதமான பூச்சிகொல்லிகள் உகந்தவையாக இருக்கும் என பல தகவல்களை அதிலிருந்து பெற முடியும். அது மட்டுமல்ல, இதில் இருக்கும் ஒரு பொத்தானை அழுத்தினால், அது உங்களுக்கு விவசாய விஞ்ஞானிகளோடு அல்லது விவசாய வல்லுனரோடு தொடர்பை ஏற்படுத்திக் கொடுக்கும். அவர்களிடத்தில் நீங்கள் ஏதேனும் கேள்விகளைக் கேட்டால் அதற்கு பதில் தருகிறார்கள் அல்லது உங்களுக்கு விளங்கும் வகையில் புரிய வைக்கிறார்கள். எனது விவசாய சகோதர சகோதரிகள் இந்த விவசாயிகள் வசதிக்கானAppஐ தங்கள் மொபைல் ஃபோனில் தரவிறக்கம் செய்து கொள்ள வேண்டும் என்று நான் விரும்புகிறேன். இது உங்களுக்கு உதவியாக இருக்கிறதா என்று முயன்று தான் பாருங்களேன். அதில் ஏதேனும் குறைபாடு இருப்பதாக நீங்கள் உணர்ந்தால், உங்கள் குறைகளை என்னிடம் தெரிவியுங்கள்.\nஎனது விவசாய சகோதர சகோதரிகளே, மற்றவர்களுக்கு எல்லாம் கோடைக்காலம் விடுமுறைக்கான பருவமாக இருக்கலாம். ஆனால் விவசாயிகளுக்கு என்னமோ அது வியர்வை சிந்தும் வேளையாக மாறி விடுகிறது. அவர்கள் மழை எப்போது வரும் என்று வழி மீது விழி வைத்துக் காத்திருகிறார்கள், அது வரும் முன்னதாக, தங்கள் நிலத்தை தயார் நிலையில் வைக்க இரவு பகலாக தங்கள் உயிரைக் கொடுத்து பாடு படுகிறார்கள்; அப்போது தான் மழைநீரின் ஒரு துளி கூட வீணாகாமல் பயன்படுத்திக் கொள்ள முடியும். விவசாயிகளுக்கு விவசாயம் செய்யும் தொடக்க காலம் மிகவும் மகத்துவம் நிறைந்த ஒன்றாகும். ஆனால் நீரில்லாது போனால் என்னவாகும் என்று நாட்டு மக்களாகிய நாமும் சிந்திக்க வேண்டும். நமது நீர் நிலைகள், நம்மருகில் நீர் பெருக்கெடுத்து ஓடும் வழிகள், ஏரிகளில் நீர் வரத்துக்கான கால்வாய்கள் ஆகியவற்றில் குப்பை கூளங்களோ ஆக்கிரமிப்புக்களோ ஏற்பட்டிருந்தால், நீர் வருவது தடைப்பட்டுப் போகும்; இதன் காரணமாக நீர்த் தேக்கம் மெல்ல மெல்ல குறைந்து போகத் தொடங்கும். மீண்டும் ஒரு முறை நாம் அந்தப் பழைய இடங்களைத் தோண்டி சுத்தம் செய்து, அதிக நீர் சேமிப்புக்கான வழிகளில் ஈடுபட முடியாதா? எத்தனை நீரை நம்மால் சேமிக்க முடியுமோ, அதுவும் முதல் மழையிலேயே கூட நாம் நீரை சேமித்து விட்டால், நீர் நிலைகள் நிறைந்து விட்டால், நமது நதிகளும் குளங்களும் நிறைந்து விட்டால், பின்மழை பொய்த்தாலும் கூட, நமக்கு ஏற்படும் இழப்பு குறைவாகவே இருக்கும். இந்த முறை 5 இலட்சம் ஏரிகள், நீர்ப்பாசனக் குளங்களை ஏற்படுத்தும் முயற்ச்சியை மேற்க்கொண்டிருப்பதை நீங்கள் கவனித்திருக்கலாம். மன்ரேகா மூலமாக நீர் சேமிப்புக்காக சொத்துக்களை உருவாக்கும் முயற்ச்சியை எடுத்திருக்கிறோம். கிராமம் தோறும் நீர் சேமிக்க வேண்டும், எதிர் வரும் மழைக்காலத்தில் ஒவ்வொரு சொட்டு நீரையும் எப்படி சேமிப்பது. கிராமத்தின் நீர் கிராமத்திலேயே இருத்தல் வேண்டும் என்ற இயக்கத்தை செயல்படுத்துவோம், நீங்கள் திட்டம் தீட்டுங்கள், அரசின் திட்டங்களோடு உங்களை இணைத்துக் கொள்ளுங்கள், நீர் தொடர்பாக ஒரு மக்கள் இயக்கத்தை ஆரம்பிக்கலாம், இதன் மூலம் நீரின் மகத்துவம், முக்கியத்துவம் அனைவருக்கும் தெரிய வைக்கப் படுவதோடு, நீர் சேமிப்பில் அனைவரும் ஒன்றிணைய முடியும். நாட்டில் இது போன்ற விழிப்புணர்வை ஏற்படுத்திய கிராமங்கள் பல இருக்கலாம், முன்னோடி விவசாயிகள் பலர் இருக்கலாம், பல விழிப்புணர்வு கொண்ட குடிமக்கள் இருக்கலாம். ஆனால் இப்போது இதை மேலும் உத்வேகத்தோடு செய்ய வேண்டிய வேளை வந்திருக்கிறது.\nஎனதருமை விவசாய சகோதர சகோதரிகளே, நான் மீண்டும் ஒரு முறை இந்த விஷயத்தை உங்களிடம் தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன். சில நாட்கள் முன்பாக இந்திய அரசு ஒரு மிகப் பெரிய விவசாயிகள் விழாவுக்கு ஏற்பாடு செய்திருந்தது, என்னவெல்லாம் நவீன தொழில்நுட்பம் அறிமுகப்படுத்தப்பட்டிருக்கிறது என்று அப்போது என்னால் பார்க்க முடிந்தது, என்ன மாற்றம் ஏற்பட்டிருக்கிறது விவசாயத் துறையில் என்று உணர முடிந்தது, ஆனாலும் கூட இவை விளைநிலங்கள் வரை கொண்டு சேர்க்கப்பட வேண்டும், உரங்கள் பயன்பாட்டைக் குறைக்க வேண்டும் என்று விவசாயிகளே கூட சொல்ல ஆரம்பித்து விட்டார்கள். நான் இதை வரவேற்கிறேன். அதிக உரங்களின் தவறான பயன்பாடு நமது பூமித் தாயை நோய்வாய்ப்படச் செய்கிறது, நாம் நமது பூமித் தாயின் மைந்தர்கள், அப்படி இருக்கையில் நாம் எப்படி நமது தாய் நோய்வாய்ப்படுவதை பார்த்துக் கொண்டிருக்க முடியும்? நல்ல மசாலாப் பொருட்களைச் சேர்த்தால், உணவு சுவையும் மணமும் கூடியதாக ஆகிறது, ஆனால் அதே மசாலாவை அளவுக்கு அதிகம் சேர்த்தால், உணவு உண்ண வேண்டும் என்று மனதுக்கு தோன்றுமா? அளவுக்கு மிஞ்சினால் அமிழ்தும் விஷம் தானே?\nஉரங்கள் விஷயமும் இப்படித் தான், உரம் என்ன தான் உன்னதமானதாக இருந்தாலும், சரி, அளவுக்கு அதிகமாக உரத்தைப் பயன்படுத்தினால், அதுவே கூட அழிவுக்கான பாதையில் கொண்டு சேர்த்து விடும். ஒவ்வொரு விஷயத்திலும் நிதானம் தேவை, இதனால் செலவும் குறைவாகும், உங்கள் பணமும் மிச்சமாகும். குறைந்த செலவு நிறைந்த விளைச்சல், குறைந்த முதலீடு, அதிக லாபம் என்பதே நமது இலக்கு, இந்த மந்திரத்தை மனதில் கொண்டு, அறிவியல் முறைகளைக் கையாண்டு நாம் நமது விவசாயத்தை முன்னெடுத்துச் செல்ல வேண்டும். நீர் சேமிப்பு விஷயத்தில் நாம் என்னவெல்லாம் முக்கியமான பணிகளை மேற்கொள்ள வேண்டுமோ, மழை வர இன்னும் ஒன்றிரண்டு மாதங்கள் இருக்கையில் நாம் அதிக முனைப்போடு அவற்றில் ஈடுபட வேண்டும். எந்த அளவு நீரை சேமிக்க முடிகிறதோ, அத்தனைக்கத்தனை விவசாயிகளுக்கு பலன் கிட்டும், வாழ்க்கையில் அந்த அளவுக்கு சேமிப்பு அதிகமாகும்.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 7ஆம் தேதி உலக சுகாதார தினம், இதன் மையக்கருத்தாக Beat Diabetes இருக்கிறது, அதாவது நீரிழிவு நோயை முறியடிப்போம் என்பது பொருள். நீரிழிவு நோய் என்ற ஒரு நோய் மற்ற நோய்களின் வருகைக்கு பட்டுக்கம்பள வரவேற்பு அளிக்கும் கேடாக விளங்குகிறது. ஒரு முறை நீரிழிவு நோய் பீடித்து விட்டால், அதன் பின்னர் ஏகப்பட்ட நோய்கள் நங்கூரமிட்டு உடலைத் தங்கள் இருப்பிடமாக்கிக் கொள்ளும். 2014ம் ஆண்டு இந்தியாவில் சுமார் 6½ கோடி நீரிழிவு நோயாளிகள் இருந்தார்கள். ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ நிகழும் இறப்புக்களில் 3 சதவீதம் நீரிழிவு நோய் காரணமாக நிகழ்கிறது என்று புள்ளிவிவரங்கள் தெரிவிக்கின்றன. நீரிழிவு நோய் இரு வகைப்படும், ஒன்று type 1, மற்றது type 2. Type 1 என்பது பரம்பரை பரம்பரையாக வருவது, hereditary, தாய் தந்தைக்கு இருப்பதால் பிள்ளைக்கும் ஏற்படுகிறது. Type 2, பழக்கங்கள் காரணமாக, வயது காரணமாக, உடல் பருமன் காரணமாக ஏற்படுகிறது. நம்மால் இதை இருகரம் நீட்டி வரவேற்கிறோம். உலகம் முழுக்க நீரிழிவு நோய் கவலையை ஏற்படுத்தியிருக்கிறது என்பதால் இதையே 7ஆம் தேதி உலக சுகாதார தினத்தின் மையக்கருவாக இதை அமைத்திருக்கிறார்கள். நமது வாழ்க்கை முறை இதற்குப் பெரிய காரணமாக அமைந்திருக்கிறது. உடல் உழைப்பு குறைந்து கொண்டே வருகிறது.\nவியர்வையை சுத்தமாக நாம் பெருக்குவதில்லை, நடைப்பழக்கம் ஏதும் கிடையாது. விளையாட்டுக்களைக் கூட கணிப்பொறியில் தான் விளையாடுகிறோம், கணிப்பொறி இல்லாத விளையாட்டுக்கள் விளையாடுவதில்லை. ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 7ஆம் தேதியால் கருத்தூக்கம் பெற்று நாம் நமது வாழ்வுகளில் நீரிழிவு நோயைத் தோற்கடிக்கும் விதமாக செயல்பாடுகளில் இறங்க முடியுமா? உங்களுக்கு யோகாசனங்கள் செய்வதில் நாட்டம் இருந்தால் அதில் ஈடுபடுங்கள், இல்லையென்றால் ஓடியோ நடந்தோ பழகலாம். என் நாட்டின் ஒவ்வொரு குடிமகனும் ஆரோக்கியமாக இருந்தால், எனது பாரதமும் ஆரோக்கியமாக இருக்கும். சில வேளைகளில் சங்கடப் பட்டுக்கொண்டு நாம் மருத்துவப் பரிசோதனை செய்து கொள்வதில்லை. நிலைமை மோசமடைந்த பிறகு தான் ஐயோ, ரொம்ப காலமாகவே நீரிழிவு நோய் இருந்திருக்கிறது என்பது தெரிய வரும். பரிசோதனை செய்து கொள்வதால் என்னவாகிப் போய் விடும், இதையாவது செய்யுங்களேன், இப்போது தான் அனைத்து வசதிகளும் இருக்கின்றனவே. இது மிகவும் சுலபமாக நடந்து விடும். கண்டிப்பாக இதைச் செய்யுங்கள்.\nமார்ச் மாதம் 24ஆம் தேதி உலக காச நோய் தினம் கடைப்பிடிக்கப்பட்டது. என் சிறு வயதில், டிபி என்ற பெயரைக் கேட்டவுடனேயே மக்கள் பயந்து போய் விடுவது என் நினைவில் இன்னும் இருக்கிறது. அவ்வளவு தான், மரணம் நிச்சயம் என்று தீர்மானித்தே விடுவார்கள். ஆனால் இப்போது காச நோயால் அத்தனை பயம் வருவதில்லை, ஏனென்றால் காசநோய்க்கு நிவாரணம் உண்டு என்பது அனைவருக்கும் தெரியும். காசநோயோடு மரணம் தொடர்பு படுத்தப்பட்ட போது நாம் அஞ்சினோம் என்பது ஒரு காலம், ஆனால் இப்போதோ நாம் காச நோய் தொடர்பாக கவனக் குறைவாக இருக்கிறோம். மற்ற நாடுகளில் இருக்கும் காச நோயாளிகள் எண்ணிக்கையோடு ஒப்பிடுகையில் நம் நாட்டில் குறைவு தான். காச நோயிலிருந்து விடுதலை பெற வேண்டுமென்றால் சரியான சிகிச்சை அவசியம், முழுமையான சிகிச்சை முக்கியம். அரைகுறையாக சிகிச்சையை இடையில் விட்டு விட்டால், நோய் மீண்டும் வந்து விடும். அக்கம் பக்கம் இருப்பவர்களால் கூட, காச நோய் வந்திருக்கிறதா இல்லையா என்று சோதனை செய்து பாருங்கள் என்று கூறக் கூடிய அளவுக்கு காச நோய் பற்றி தெரிந்திருக்கிறது. இருமல் வருகிறது, காய்ச்சல் ஏற்படுகிறது, உடல் மெலிந்து கொண்டே வருகிறது என்றால் காச நோய் ஏற்பட்டிருக்குமோ என்ற ஐயப்பாடு, அக்கம்பக்கத்தாருக்குக் கூட எழுகிறது. அதாவது, நோய் இருக்கிறதா என்று உடனடியாக தெரிந்து கொண்டு சிகிச்சை பெறக் கூடியதாக இது இருக்கிறது.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, இந்தக் கண்ணோட்டத்தில் ஏகப்பட்ட ஆய்வுகள் நடைபெற்றுக் கொண்டிருக்கின்றன. 13,500க்கும் அதிகமான microscopy மையங்கள் இருகின்றன. 4 இலட்சத்துக்கும் அதிகமான dot providerகள் இருக்கின்றன. பல மேம்பட்ட பரிசோதனைக் கூடங்கள் இருக்கின்றன, அனைத்து சேவைகளும் இலவசமாகக் கிடைக்கின்றன. ஒரு முறை பரிசோதனையாவது செய்து கொள்ளுங்கள். சரியான சிகிச்சையால் இந்த நோய்க்கு ஒரு முடிவு கட்ட முடியும். காச நோயாகட்டும், நீரிழிவு நோயாகட்டும், நாம் அவற்றை முறியடித்தாக வேண்டும். இந்தியாவை இந்த நோய்களின் பிடியிலிருந்து விடுவித்தாக வேண்டும். ஆனால் உங்களின் ஒத்துழைப்பு இல்லாமல் வெறும் அரசுகள், மருத்துவர்கள், மருந்துகளால் மட்டும் இவற்றை ஒழிக்க முடியாது. ஆகையால் நாம் நீரிழிவு நோயை முறியடிக்க வேண்டும், காச நோயை ஒழித்து விட வேண்டும் என்று நான் நாட்டு மக்களிடம் வேண்டிக் கேட்டுக் கொள்கிறேன்.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, ஏப்ரல் மாதம் பல முக்கியமான நிகழ்வுகள் நடைபெற இருக்கின்றன. குறிப்பாக ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 14ஆம் தேதி பீம்ராவ் பாபா சாஹேப் அம்பேட்கர் அவர்களின் பிறந்த நாள். அவரது 125வது பிறந்த நாளை முன்னிட்டு ஆண்டு முழுவதும் நாடெங்கும் கொண்டாடப்பட்டது. Mhow – மோ அவர் பிறந்த இடம், லண்டனில் அவர் கல்வி பயின்றார், நாகபுரியில் அவரது அரசியல் வாழ்வு தொடங்கியது, தில்லியின் 26 அலிபூர் ரோட்டில் அவரது மகாபரிநிர்வாண நிகழ்வு அரங்கேறியது, மும்பையில் அவரது அந்திமக் கிரியைகள் நடைபெற்ற இடத்தில் நினைவிடம் என இந்த ஐந்து புனிதமான இடங்களை மேம்படுத்த நாம் முயற்ச்சிகளை மேற்க்கொண்டு வருகிறோம். இந்த ஆண்டு ஏப்ரல் மாதம் 14ஆம் தேதியன்று பாபா சாஹேப் அம்பேட்கர் அவர்களின் பிறந்த இடமான Mhowவுக்கு செல்லக் கூடிய பாக்கியம் எனக்குக் கிடைத்திருக்கிறது. ஒரு சிறந்த குடிமகனாக ஆகத் தேவையான அனைத்தையும் பாபா சாஹேப் அவர்கள் நமக்கு அளித்திருக்கிறார்கள். அவர் காட்டிய வழியில் பயணித்து, ஒரு நல்ல குடிமகனாக வாழ்ந்து நாம் அவருக்கு சிறப்பானதொரு அஞ்சலியை காணிக்கையாக்க முடியும்.\nஇன்னும் சில நாட்களில் விக்ரம் ஆண்டு தொடங்கி விடும். புத்தாண்டு பல்வேறு மாநிலங்களில் பல்வேறு ரூபங்களில் கொண்டாடப் படுகிறது. சிலர் இதை புதிய சம்வத்ஸரம் அதாவது புத்தாண்டு என்கிறார்கள், சிலர் இதை Gudi-Padwa என்கிறார்கள், சிலர் இதை வர்ஷ பிரதிபதா என்கிறார்கள், சிலர் இதை உகாதி என்கிறார்கள். ஆனால் இந்தியாவின் கிட்டத்தட்ட அனைத்து இடங்களிலும் இதற்கென ஒரு மகத்துவம் இருக்கிறது. அனைவருக்கும் எனது புத்தாண்டு நல்வாழ்த்துக்கள்.\nஎனது மனதின் குரலை நீங்கள் எப்போது வேண்டுமானாலும் கேட்கலாம் என்று நான் கடந்த முறையே கூட கூறியிருந்தேன், இதை நீங்கள் அறிவீர்கள். சுமார் 20 மொழிகளில் இதைக் கேட்கலாம். உங்களுக்கு சௌகரியமான நேரத்தில் அதைக் கேட்டுக் கொள்ளலாம். உங்கள் மொபைல் ஃபோனில் அதைக் கேட்கலாம். நீங்கள் மிஸ்ட் கால் ஒன்றைக் கொடுத்தால் மட்டும் போதும். இந்தச் சேவை தொடங்கப்பட்டு ஒரு மாத காலம் மட்டுமே ஆகிறது. ஆனால் 35 இலட்சம் பேர்கள் இதனால் பயன் அடைந்திருக்கிறார்கள். நீங்களும் எண்ணைக் குறித்துக் கொள்ளுங்கள் 81908-81908. நான் எண்ணை மீண்டும் அறிவிக்கிறேன். 81908-81908. நீங்கள் மிஸ்டு கால் கொடுங்கள், எப்போது உங்களுக்கு நேரம் வாய்க்கிறதோ அப்போது பழைய மனதின் குரல் நிகழ்ச்சிகளைக் கேட்டுக் கொள்ளலாம், உங்களின் மொழியிலேயே கேட்டுக் கொள்ளலாம். உங்களோடு இணைந்து கொள்வதில் எனக்கும் மிக்க மகிழ்ச்சி.\nஎனதருமை நாட்டு மக்களே, உங்களுக்கு என் நெஞ்சார்ந்த நல் வாழ்த்துக்கள். மிக்க நன்றி.\n"

లేక, ఈ అవకాశాన్ని మన కు ప్రయోజనం కలిగేటట్లు ఉపయోగించుకొని క్రీడలను ప్రోత్సహిద్దామా?\nఫుట్ బాల్, ఫుట్ బాల్, ఫుట్ బాల్ అనే పదం ఈ సంవత్సరమంతా మారుమోగే వాతావరణాన్ని మనం సృష్టించాలి– పాఠశాలల్లోను, కళాశాలల్లోను, ఆ మాటకొస్తే భారత దేశం ప్రతి మూల మూలనా. మన యువత, బడులలో మన పిల్లలు ఫుట్ బాల్ ఆడుతూ చెమటతో తడిసి ముద్దయిపోవాలి. అలా జరిగిందంటే, ఆతిథ్యం ఇస్తున్నందుకు మనకు సిసలైన మజా దక్కుతుంది. కాబట్టి, మనం అందరం ఫుట్ బాల్ను గ్రామ గ్రామానికి, వీధి వీధికి తీసుకు వెళ్లడానికి ప్రయత్నించాలి. ఇప్పటి నుంచి 2017 లో ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ అండర్-17 వరల్డ్ కప్ జరిగే దాకా, యువతలో ఒక రకమైన ఉద్వేగాన్ని నింపుదాం. ఈ కార్యక్రమానికి ఆతిథ్యం ఇవ్వడం వల్ల కలిగే మేలు ఏమిటంటే ఇక్కడ అనేక మౌలిక క్రీడా సదుపాయాలు రూపుదిద్దుకొంటాయి. కానీ, వ్యక్తిగతంగా నాకు ఎప్పుడు ఆనందం కలుగుతుందంటే.. మనం మన దేశంలోని ప్రతి యువకుడిని ఈ క్రీడతో మమేకం చేయగలిగినప్పుడే.\nమిత్రులారా.. 2017 లో ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ అండర్-17 వరల్డ్ కప్ ను మనం మన ప్రయోజనాల కోసం ఎంత ఉత్తమంగా ఉపయోగించుకోగలమనే విషయంలో మీ అభిప్రనయాలు ఏమిటో నేను మీ నుంచి తెలుసుకోవాలనుకుంటున్నాను. ఈ కార్యక్రమం ఎలా ఉండాలి? ఈ సందర్భం తగినంత వేగం పుంజుకోవడానికి ఏ విధమైన కార్యక్రమాలను మనం ఏడాది పొడవునా నిర్వహించాలి? మనం ఇంకా ఏ యే అంశాలలో మెరుగుదల సాధించవలసిన అవసరం ఉంది? 2017 ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ అండర్-17 వరల్డ్ కప్ ద్వారా ఈ ఆట పట్ల భారతదేశం యువతలో అభిరుచిని మనం ఎలా పెంచగలం? ఈ క్రీడతో సాన్నిహిత్యం ఏర్పరచుకొనేటట్లుగా ప్రభుత్వంలో, విద్యా సంస్థలలో, సామాజిక సంస్థలలో పోటీతత్వాన్ని ఎలా చొప్పించగలం?\nక్రికెట్ లో ఇదంతా చోటు చేసుకోవడాన్ని మనం చూస్తూనే ఉన్నాం; ఇవే పార్శ్వాలను ఇతర క్రీడా విభాగాలకు కూడా వర్తించేలా మనం ప్రయత్నించాలి. ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ కార్యక్రమం ఇలా చేయడానికి ఒక విశిష్ట అవకాశాన్ని అందిస్తోంది. ఈ అవకాశాన్ని ఎంత బాగా ఉపయోగించుకోవచ్చో మీరు మీ సలహాలు, సూచనలను నాకు పంపించగలరా? ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ కార్యక్రమం\nభారతదేశాన్ని ఒక బ్రాండ్ గా నెలకొల్పే ఒక మహదవకాశంగా నేను భావిస్తున్నాను. భారత యువత శక్తి సామర్థ్యాలు ఏమిటో ప్రపంచం గుర్తించగలిగేటట్లు చేయడానికి ఇదొక అవకాశమని నేననుకొంటున్నాను– అది ఏదైనా మ్యాచ్ ను గెలిచామా లేక ఓడామా అనే అర్థంలో కాదు సుమా. 2017 ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ అండర్-17 వరల్డ్ కప్ ఆతిథ్యానికి సిద్ధపడుతూ, మనం శక్తి సామర్థ్యాలను పోగేసుకొని వాటిని ప్రదర్శించవచ్చు.. ప్రదర్శించవచ్చు; అలా చేస్తూనే, మనం భారతదేశ ప్రతిష్టను పెంపొందించే బ్రాండింగ్ ను కూడా చేపట్టవచ్చు.\nమీరు 2017 ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ అండర్-17 వరల్డ్ కప్ నకు సంబంధించిన మీ సలహాలు, సూచనలను NarendraModiApp ద్వారా నాకు పంపించవచ్చు; వాటిని అందుకోవడం గురించి నేను ఎదురుచూస్తాను. లోగో ఎలా ఉండాలి.., స్లోగన్లు ఎలా ఉండాలి.., భారతదేశమంతటా ఈ విషయాన్ని ప్రచారం చేయడానికి ఎలాంటి పద్ధతులను పాటిద్దాం?, పాటలు ఎలా ఉండాలి?, సావనీర్ లలో ఏయే అంశాలు ఉండాలి? .. మిత్రులారా ఆలోచించండి. ఇంకా నేను ఏం కోరుకుంటున్నానంటే.. ప్రతి యువకుడు, ప్రతి యువతి 2017 ఎఫ్ ఐ ఎఫ్ ఎ అండర్-17 వరల్డ్ కప్ యొక్క దూత అవ్వాలి. మీరు ఈ కార్యక్రమంలో పెద్ద ఎత్తున పాలుపంచుకోవాలి. భారతదేశ ప్రతిష్టను నిర్మించేందుకు ఇది ఒక సువర్ణావకాశం.\nప్రియమైన నా విద్యార్థులారా, సెలవులలో ఎక్కడికన్నా ప్రయాణమై వెళ్లాలని మీరు ఆలోచించే ఉంటారు. విదేశాలకు వెళ్లే వాళ్లు చాలా తక్కువ మంది ఉంటారు. ఎక్కువ మంది వాళ్ళ వాళ్ళ రాష్ట్రాల లోపలే వారమో పది రోజులో యాత్రలు చేస్తారు. కొద్ది మంది వారి రాష్ట్రం వెలుపలి ప్రదేశాలను సందర్శిస్తారు. గతంలో కూడా నేను మీ అందరికీ ఒక విన్నపం చేశాను.. మీరు చూసిన స్థలాల ఫొటోలను అప్ లోడ్ చేయండని. నేను చూశాను ఏ పనినైతే మన పర్యాటక విభాగం గాని, సాంస్కృతిక విభాగం గాని, రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వాలు గాని, లేదా భారత ప్రభుత్వం గాని చేయలేవో.. ఆ పనిని దేశపు కోట్లాది యాత్రికులు చేసి చూపెట్టారు; ఎలాంటి భవ్యమైన ప్రదేశాల ఫొటోలను వారు అప్ లోడ్ చేశారంటే.. వాటిని చూడటం నిజంగా ఎంతో ఆనందాన్నిస్తుంది.\nఈ పనిని మనం ఇంకా ముందుకు తీసుకెళ్లాలి. ఈసారి కూడా ఈ పనిని చేయండి. అయితే – ఈ సారి వాటి మీద ఏదైనా రాయండి. కేవలం ఫొటోనే కాదు… మీకున్న రచనా ఆసక్తిని ప్రదర్శించండి. కొత్త ప్రదేశంలోకి వెళ్తే దానిని చూస్తే తెలుసుకోవడానికి, నేర్చుకోవడానికి ఎంతో కొంత లభిస్తుంది. ఏ అంశాలను, విషయాలను మనం తరగతి గదిలో నేర్చుకోలేమో.. ఏవైతే మన కుటుంబంలో స్నేహితుల మధ్య నేర్చుకోలేమో.. అవి తిరగడం ద్వారా ఎక్కువగా నేర్చుకునేందుకు లభిస్తాయి. ఇంకా కొత్త ప్రదేశాల కొత్తదనం అనుభవం అవుతుంది. మనుషులు, వారి భాష, వారి ఆహారపు అలవాట్లు, మాటలు అక్కడి జీవన విధానం.. ఒకటేంటి. ఎన్నెన్నో చూడటానికి లభిస్తాయి. పరిశీలన లేని ప్రయాణీకుడు రెక్కలు లేని పక్షి వంటి వాడు అని అన్నారు ఎవరో. చూడటానికి మీకు నిజంగా ఆసక్తి ఉంటే, వాటిని చూసే అంతర్ దృష్టిని కూడా మీరు సిద్ధం చేసుకోవాలి. భారతదశం వైవిధ్యాల నిలయం. ఒకసారి చూడటానికి బయలుదేరితే, జీవితం అంతా చూస్తూనే ఉంటారు.. చూస్తూనే ఉంటారు; ఎప్పటికీ తనివి తీరదు. నేను చాలా అదృష్టవంతుడిని. తిరగడానికి నాకు చాలా అవకాశం లభించింది. మీ లాగా నేను ముఖ్యమంత్రి, ప్రధాన మంత్రి కానప్పుడు.. వయస్సులో చాలా చోట్ల తిరిగాను. దేశంలో నేను సందర్శించని జిల్లా అంటూ బహుశా లేదేమో.\nజీవితాన్ని సరిద్దుకోవడంలో ప్రయాణం ఒక శక్తిమంతమైన పాత్రను పోషిస్తుంది. ఇప్పుడు భారత దేశంలో యువతలో ప్రయాణం పట్ల మక్కువ, జిజ్ఞాస పెరుగుతూ పోతున్నాయి. ముందు రోజుల్లో లాగా అందరూ వెళ్లే మార్గంలో, తయారుగా ఉన్న మార్గంలో వీరు వెళ్లడం లేదు. వారు ఏదో కొత్తది చేయాలనుకుంటున్నారు; వారు కాస్త కొత్తవి చూడాలనుకుంటున్నారు. దీనిని నేను ఒక మంచి సంకేతంగా భావిస్తాను. మన యువతీయువకులు సాహసవంతులు కావాలి. ఎక్కడైతే ఎప్పుడూ కాలు మోప లేదో, అక్కడ కాలు మోపడానికి ఇష్టపడాలి.\nఈ సందర్భంగా కోల్ ఇండియాకు ప్రత్యేక అభినందనలు తెలపాలని అనుకుంటున్నాను. వెస్టర్న్ కోల్ ఫీల్డ్ లిమిటెడ్ (డబ్ల్యుసిఎల్) నాగ్పూర్ సమీపంలోని సావనేర్ గ్రామం దగ్గర- అక్కడ బొగ్గు గనులు ఉన్నాయి- అక్కడ పర్యావరణ మైత్రీపూర్వకమైన మైన్ టూరిజం సర్క్యూట్ ను తీర్చిదిద్దింది. సాధారణంగా మనం బొగ్గు గనులు అనేసరికి అవేవో చూడదగ్గవి కావు అని అనుకుంటాం. అక్కడి గని పనివారి చిత్రాలు మనం చూసినట్లయితే, అక్కడికే వెళ్తే ఇంకా ఎలా ఉంటుందో అని అబ్బురపడతాం. మనకొక సామెత కూడా ఉంది.. అదేంటంటే.. బొగ్గులో చేయిపెడితే చేతులు నల్లగా అయిపోతాయి అని. దీంతో మనుషులు దూరంగా పారిపోతారు. కానీ ఈ బొగ్గునే టూరిజానికి గమ్యంగా వెస్టర్న్ కోల్ ఫీల్డ్స్ లిమిటెడ్ చేసి చూపించింది. నేను చాలా ఆనందంగా ఉండటానికి కారణం ఏమిటంటే.. ఇప్పుడిప్పుడే ఇది ప్రారంభమైంది. నాగ్పూర్ సమీపంలోని సావనేర్ గ్రామ సమీపంలో ఎకో ఫ్రెండ్లీ మైన్ టూరిజం సైట్ ను ఇప్పటి వరకు 10,000 మందికి పైగా తిలకించారు. ఏదైనా ఒక కొత్తదానిని చూడాలంటే ఇదే మనకు ఒక అవకాశాన్ని ప్రసాదిస్తోంది.\nఈసారి సెలవుల్లో ఊళ్లు తిరగడానికి వెళ్లినపుడు మీరు కూడా శుభ్రత కోసం ఏదన్నా చేయగలరా… ఈ మధ్య ఒక విషయం కనిపిస్తోంది. నిజానికి విమర్శించాలంటే ఇంకా ఎన్నో సందర్భాలున్నాయి కానీ మొత్తం మీద ఒక చైతన్యం వచ్చిందనే చెప్పాలి. పర్యాటక స్థలాల్లో పరిశుభ్రత ఉండేలా ప్రజలు ప్రయత్నం చేస్తున్నారు. ఆ ప్రదేశాన్ని సందర్శించే పర్యాటకులు ప్రయత్నిస్తున్నారు. అక్కడ శాశ్వత నివాసం ఉండే వారు కూడా తమ వంతు కృషి చేస్తున్నారు. శాస్త్రీయమైన పద్ధతిలో ఈ ప్రయత్నం జరగడం లేదేమో కానీ పని మాత్రం జరుగుతోంది. మీరు ఒక పర్యాటకుడిగా వెళ్లినపుడు ఆ ప్రదేశంలో యువజనులు ఈ విషయంలో తోడ్పడగలరని నాకు నమ్మకం ఉంది.\nపర్యాటకం ద్వారా ఉపాధికి ఎంతో అవకాశం ఉంది. ప్రపంచ దేశాలతో పోలిస్తే భారతదేశం పర్యాటక రంగంలో చాలా వెనుకబడి ఉంది. కానీ మనం 125 కోట్ల మంది దేశ ప్రజలం. పర్యాటకాన్ని బలోపేతం చేయాలనుకుంటే కనుక, ప్రపంచాన్నే మనం ఆకర్షించగలం. ప్రపంచ పర్యాటకంలో పెద్ద భాగాన్ని మనం సొంతం చేసుకోగలుగుతాం. ఇంకా మన కోట్లాది యువ జనానికి ఉపాధి అవకాశాలు చూపగలం. ప్రభుత్వం గానీ, సంస్థలు గానీ, సమాజం గానీ, వ్యక్తులు గానీ- అందరం కలసి దీన్ని సాధించే పని చేద్దాం. రండి, ఈ దిశగా మనం ఒక ప్రయత్నం చేద్దాం.\nప్రియమైన నా యువ మిత్రులారా, సెలవురోజులను అలా ఊరికే కొద్ది కొద్దిగా వ్యర్థం చేసేయడం నాకు నచ్చదు. మీరు కూడా ఇలా ఆలోచించి చూడండి. మీ సెలవులు, జీవితంలో కీలకమైన సంవత్సరాలు అంతకన్నా కీలకమైన సమయం.. అలానే కరగిపోవడం ఏమిటి? మీరు ఆలోచించడానికి ఒక విషయం చెబుతాను. సెలవుల్లో ఒక కొత్త ప్రతిభను మీ వ్యక్తిత్వానికి జోడించే సంకల్పం తీసుకోగలరా మీరు..? ఒక వేళ మీకు ఈదడం రాకపోతే, సెలవుల్లో ఈత నేర్చుకోవాలని సంకల్పించవచ్చు. సైకిల్ తొక్కడం రాకపోతే సెలవుల్లో సైకిల్ నేర్చుకుంటానని నిర్ణయం తీసుకోవచ్చు. ఇప్పటికీ కేవలం రెండు వేళ్ళతో కంప్యూటర్ మీద టైపు చేస్తున్నానే అని మీరు అనుకుంటే నేను సరైన రీతిలో టైపింగ్ నేర్చుకోకూడదా అని ఎందుకు అనుకోరు? మన వ్యక్తిత్వ వికాసానికి ఎన్నో రకాల నైపుణ్యాలున్నాయి? వాటిని ఎందుకు నేర్చుకోకూడదు..? మనలోని కొన్ని లోపాలను ఎందుకు దూరం చేసుకోకూడదు? మనలోని కొన్ని శక్తులను ఎందుకు పెంచుకోకూడదు? ఇప్పుడు ఒక ఆలోచన చేసి చూడండి.\nవీటిలో మీకు చాలా క్లాసులు అవసరమనో, శిక్షకుడు కావాలనో, చాలా పెద్ద ఫీజు కట్టాలనో, పెద్ద బడ్జెట్ వెచ్చించాలనో.. ఇలా ఏమీ లేదు. మీరు మీ చుట్టుపక్కలే చూడండి. మీరు ఒకసారి నిర్ణయించుకున్నారనుకుందాం చెత్త నుంచి ఉత్తమమైంది తయారుచేస్తాను.. అని. కొన్ని పరిశీలించండి; వాటి నుంచి తయారు చేయడం మొదలుపెట్టండి. చూడండి– మీకు సంతోషం కలుగుతుంది. సాయంత్రం అయ్యే సరికి ఈ చెత్తా చెదారంలో నుంచి మీరు ఏం తయారు చేశారో.. మీకు చిత్ర లేఖనం అంటే ఇష్టం. కానీ బొమ్మలు గీయడం రాదు. అయితేనేం, మొదలయితే పెట్టండి. అదే వస్తుంది. మీరు మీ సెలవు దినాలను మీ వ్యక్తిత్వ వికాసానికి, ప్రావీణ్యం సాధించడానికి, మీ నైపుణ్యాలను మెరుగు పరచుకోవడానికి తప్పనిసరిగా వినియోగించాలి. అలాంటివి రంగాలు లెక్కలేనన్ని ఉన్నాయి. నేను చెప్పిన వాటిలోనే కృషి చేయాలని లేదు. ఆ నైపుణ్యం వల్ల మీ వ్యక్తిత్వానికి ఉనికి ఏర్పడుతుంది. మీ ఆత్మవిశ్వాసం చెప్పలేనంత పెరుగుతుంది. సెలవులు అయ్యాక స్కూలుకు తిరిగి వెళ్లినప్పడు, కాలేజికి వెళ్లినప్పుడు మీ స్నేహితులతో చెబుతారు. నేను సెలవుల్లో ఇది నేర్చుకున్నాను అని. ఒక వేళ వాళ్లు అది నేర్చుకోలేదునుకోండి.. వాళ్లనుకుంటారు అరే నేను నష్టపోయాను. నువ్వు నేర్చుకుని వచ్చావు అని ఇలా ఆలోచిస్తారు. ఇది సహజం. కాబట్టి మీరు తప్పకుండా చేస్తారని నాకు నమ్మకం ఉంది. ఇంకా మీరు ఏం నేర్చుకున్నారో నాకు చెప్పండి. చెబుతారు కదూ.\nఈసారి www.mygov.in సైట్ లో ‘మన్కీ బాత్’ కోసం అనేకమైన సూచనలు అందాయి. వాటిలోంచి ఒకటి ఇదీ..\n“నమస్తే ప్రధాన మంత్రి గారూ. నా పేరు అభి చతుర్వేది. గత వేసవి సెలవులలో మీరు పిట్టలకి కూడా వేసవి తాపం ఉంటుందని అన్నారు. ఓ పాత్రలో నీరు పోసి బాల్కనీలోనో, డాబా పైనో పెట్టాలని, పిట్టలు వచ్చి నీళ్లు తాగుతాయని చెప్పారు. నేను అదే పనిని చేశాను. ఎంతో సంతోషం కలిగింది. ఈ సాకుతో చాలా పిట్టలతో నాకు స్నేహం కుదిరింది. ఈ విషయాన్ని ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’లో మీరు మరోసారి చెప్పాలనే మిమ్మల్ని అభ్యర్థిస్తున్నాను. మీకు ఇవే నా కృతజ్ఞతలు.”\nప్రియమైన నా దేశపు సాటి పౌరులారా.. నేను ఈ చిన్నారి అభి చతుర్వేది కి కృతజ్ఞత తెలియజేసుకుంటున్నాను. నాకు ఫోన్ చేసి, నేను చెప్పిన విషయాన్ని ఈ బాలుడు నాకు గుర్తు చేశాడు. నిజం చెప్పాలంటే, నేను దాని గురించే మరచిపోయాను. ఇంకా.. నాకు బుర్రలో లేదు ఈ విషయంపై నేనేమైనా చెబుతానా అనేది. కానీ, అభి నాకు జ్ఞాపకం చేశాడు.. నిరుడు నేను పక్షులు తాగడానికి నీళ్లతో నింపిన ఒక మట్టి పాత్రను నింపి పెట్టండి.. అని చెప్పానన్న సంగతిని.\nస్నేహితులారా.. నేను అభి చతుర్వేదికి ధన్యవాదాలు చెప్పాలనుకుంటున్నాను. ఆ బాలుడు నాకు ఫోన్ చేసి ఒక మంచి పనిని గురించి తెలియజెప్పాడు. పోయినసారి .. ఆ.. ఇప్పుడు నాకు గుర్తుకొచ్చింది. నేను అప్పట్లో మీకు సూచించాను. ఎండాకాలంలో పిట్టలకు మట్టి పాత్రలలో నీరు పెట్టండి అని. అభి తాను ఈ పనిని ఒక ఏడాది అంతా చేస్తూ వస్తున్నానంటూ నాకు తెలిపాడు. ఎన్నో పక్షులు తనకి స్నేహితులు అయిపోయాయని కూడా చెప్పాడు. హిందీ భాషలో మహా కవయిత్రి అయిన మహాదేవి వర్మకు పక్షులంటే ఎంతో ప్రేమ. ఆవిడ ఒక కవితలో ఇలా రాశారు.. ‘మేం నిన్ను దూరంగా ఎగిరిపోనివ్వం, మేం ధాన్యంతో ఆవరణంతా నింపేస్తాం.. నీటి కుంటను తియ్యని, చల్లని నీటితో నింపేస్తాం..’ రండి, మనం కూడా మహాదేవి వర్మ గారు చెప్పినట్లే చేద్దాం. నేను అభికి శుభాకాంక్షలు తెలియజేస్తున్నాను ఒక ముఖ్యమైన విషయాన్ని నాకు గుర్తు చేసినందుకు.\nమైసూర్కు చెందిన శిల్పా కుకే ఎంతో దయామయమైన ఒక సమస్యను మన ముందుకు తెచ్చారు. మా ఇంటి దగ్గరకు పాల వాళ్లు వస్తారు, పేపర్ అమ్మేవాళ్లు వస్తారు. పోస్ట్ మ్యాన్ వస్తారు. కొన్ని సార్లు గిన్నెలు అమ్మేవారు, బట్టలు అమ్మేవారు ఆ దారి వెంబడి వెళ్తారు. మనం ఎప్పుడన్నా వారికి మంచినీళ్లు కావాలా… అని అడిగామా? ఎప్పుడన్నా ఇచ్చామా? శిల్పా… మీరు ఎంతో సున్నితమైన విషయాన్ని ప్రస్తావించారు. మీకు ధన్యవాదాలు. ఎంతో ముఖ్యమైన అంశాన్ని మీరు ఎంతో సరళంగా, సూటిగా చెప్పారు. విషయం చాలా చిన్నది కానీ, మంచి ఎండలో పోస్ట్ మ్యాన్ మన ఇంటికి వచ్చినపుడు చల్లని నీరు తాగించామనుకోండి. అతను ఎంత సేదదీరుతాడు. నిజానికి మన దేశంలో ఇది స్వతహాగా జరిగే విషయమే. కానీ, శిల్పా… మీరు ఈ విషయం గమనించినందుకు నాకెంతో సంతోషం వేసింది.\nప్రియమైన నా రైతు సోదర సోదరీమణులారా… డిజిటల్ ఇండియా అన్న పదం మీరు చాలాసార్లు విని ఉంటారు. డిజిటల్ ఇండియా అంటే ఇది నగరాల్లో యువజనులకు సంబంధించిన సంగతి, అది వారి ప్రపంచం అనిపించవచ్చు. అది నిజం కాదు. ‘కిసాన్ సువిధా ఆప్’ అనే యాప్ మీ సౌకర్యం కోసం అందుబాటులోకి వచ్చిందని తెలిస్తే మీరు ఎంతో సంతోషపడతారు. ఈ రైతు సువిధ యాప్ని మీరు మీ మొబైల్ ఫోన్లో డౌన్ లోడ్ చేసుకోండి. వ్యవసాయానికి సంబంధించిన, వాతావరణానికి సంబంధించిన విస్తృత సమాచారం స్వయంగా మీ చేతుల్లోనే అందుబాటులోకి వస్తుంది. మార్కెట్లో పరిస్థితులేంటి… మండీలో ఎటువంటి స్థితి ఉంది.. పంట దిగుబడి సరళి ఎలా ఉంది. పొలానికి వేయవలసిన మందులు ఏవి అందుబాటులో ఉన్నాయి… ఇలాంటి ఎన్నో విషయాలు ఆ యాప్లో ఉన్నాయి. అంతే కాదు.. ఇందులో ఉన్న బటన్ మిమ్మల్ని నేరుగా వ్యవసాయ శాస్త్రవేత్తలతో, వ్యవసాయ నిపుణులతో మాట్లాడిస్తుంది. మీరేదైనా ప్రశ్నలు అడిగితే వారు జవాబు ఇస్తారు. మీకు వివరించి చెబుతారు. నా రైతు సోదరులు, సోదరీమణులు ఈ కిసాన్ సువిధ యాప్ను తమ మొబైల్ ఫోన్ పైన డౌన లోడ్ చేస్తారని ఆశిస్తున్నాను. ఒకసారి ప్రయత్నించి చూడండి. అందులో మీకు పనికొచ్చే సంగతులు ఏమన్నా ఉన్నాయేమో. అందులో ఏదన్నా లోపం ఉంది, తక్కువ సమాచారం ఉంది అంటే మీరు నాకు ఫిర్యాదు చేయవచ్చు కూడా.\nప్రియమైన నా రైతు సోదర సోదరీమణులారా… మిగిలిన ప్రజలందరికీ వేసవి అంటే సెలవుల కాలం. కానీ రైతులకు మాత్రం ఇది మరింత చెమటోడ్చి పని చేయవలసిన కాలం. రైతు వర్షం కోసం ఎదురుచూస్తాడు. వర్షం కోసం ఎదురుచూసే ముందుగా వర్షం కోసం తన భూమిని సిద్ధం చేసే పనిలో పూర్తిగా నిమగ్నమైపోతాడు. వర్షం కురిసినప్పుడు ఒక్క నీటి చుక్క కూడా వృథా కాకుండా భూమిని సిద్ధం చేసుకుంటాడు. వ్యవసాయం ప్రారంభమయ్యే రుతువు రైతులకు ఎంతో ముఖ్యమైన సమయం. కానీ, నీరు లేకపోతే ఏం జరుగుతుందన్న విషయం మన దేశవాసులందరూ కూడా ఆలోచించవలసిన విషయం. ఈ సమయంలో మనం మన చెరువులు, మన ప్రాంతంలో నీరు ప్రవహించే ప్రదేశాలు, చెరువుల్లోకి నీళ్లు వచ్చి చేరే మార్గాలు అక్కడ చెత్త చేరడం, లేదా దురాక్రమణ జరిగి నిర్మాణం జరగడం వల్ల అక్కడికి నీరు ప్రవహించడం ఆగిపోతుంది. అందువల్ల నీటి నిల్వలు క్రమేణా తగ్గిపోతున్నాయి. గతంలో నీరు ఉన్న ప్రదేశాలు, స్థలాలను మళ్లీ మనం తవ్వి చెత్త తీసి శుభ్రం చేసి మరింత నీరు వచ్చి చేరి నిల్వ ఉండేలా సిద్ధం చేయగలమా? ఎంత నీరు పొదుపు చేయగలిగితే అంత మంచిది. తొలకరి జల్లుల్లోనైనా సరే నీరు పొదుపు చేసి… చెరువులు నిండి.. మన నదులు, కాల్వలు నిండి పారాయంటే ఆ తర్వాత వర్షం కనిపించకుండా పోయినా నీటి కొరత అనేది బాధించదు. మనకు ఎక్కువ నష్టం జరగదు. అయితే మనం ప్రతి ఒక్క వాన నీటి చినుకును ఒడిసి పట్టి నిల్వ చేసుకొంటేనే ఇది సాధ్యమవుతుంది.\nఈసారి ఐదు లక్షల నీటి కుంటలను తవ్వేందుకు సంకల్పించాం. జాతీయ గ్రామీణ ఉపాధి హామీ పథకం (ఎమ్ ఎన్ ఆర్ జి ఎ) కింద కూడా నీటి సేకరణకు, అసెట్స్ క్రియేట్ చేయాలని భావిస్తున్నాం. ప్రతి ఊళ్లో, ప్రతి గ్రామంలో నీరు పొదుపు చేయాలి. రానున్న వర్షా కాలంలో ప్రతి వర్షపు చుక్కను పరిరక్షించాలి. గ్రామంలో నీరు గ్రామంలోనే ఉండాలి. ఈ ఉద్యమాన్ని ఎలా నడిపించాలో మీరు ప్రణాళికలు వేయండి. ప్రభుత్వం అమలుచేస్తున్న పథకాల్లో పాలుపంచుకోండి. నీటి వనరుల ప్రాముఖ్యత గురించి ప్రజా ఉద్యమాన్ని ఎలా నడిపించాలో మీరు ప్రణాళికలు వేయండి. ప్రభుత్వం అమలుచేస్తున్న పథకాల్లో పాలుపంచుకోండి. నీటి వనరుల ప్రాముఖ్యత గురించి ప్రజా ఉద్యమం ప్రారంభిద్దాం. నీటి వనరుల ప్రాముఖ్యత అందరూ గ్రహించేలా… నీరు పొదుపు చేసేందుకు అందరూ ప్రయత్నించేలా… ఒక ఉద్యమం ప్రారంభిద్దాం. మన దేశంలో ఎన్నో గ్రామాలు, ఎంతో మంది ప్రగతిశీలురైన రైతులు, ఎంతో మంది చైతన్యవంతులైన పౌరులు ఇప్పటికే ఈ పని చేస్తుండి ఉంటారు. అయినప్పటికీ ఇప్పుడు ఈ దిశగా ఇంకా ఎంతో ప్రయత్నం జరగడం అవసరం.. అతి ముఖ్యం.\nప్రియమైన నా రైతు సోదర, సోదరీమణులారా.. ఇటీవల భారత ప్రభుత్వం ఒక భారీ రైతు సమ్మేళనం నిర్వహించింది. ఎంత అత్యాధునిక పరిజ్ఞానం ఆవిర్భవించిందో. వ్యవసాయ రంగంలో ఎన్ని మార్పులు వచ్చాయో నేను గమనించాను. అయితే ఈ పరిజ్ఞానాన్ని పొలాల వరకు తీసుకువెళ్ళాలి. ఇప్పడు రైతులు కూడా ఇంక ఎరువులు తగ్గించాలి అంటున్నారు. ఈ పరిణామాన్ని నేను హర్షిస్తున్నాను. ఎరువులు ఎక్కువగా వాడటం వల్ల మన భూమి తల్లి అస్వస్థత పాలైంది. మనం ఈ భూమి పుత్రులం, మనం ఈ పుడమి తల్లి సంతానం. మన అమ్మ రోగాల పాలవుతుంటే ఎలా చూస్తూ ఉండగలం…? భోజనం రుచికరంగా ఉంటుంది. కానీ, ఆ మసాలా మోతాదుకు మించి వస్తే అసలు ఆ భోజనం తినగలమా… మనకి నచ్చిన ఆ ఆహారమే నోటికి చేదు అనిపించదా?\nఈ ఎరువుల మోతాదుకు మించి మీరు వాడితే అది వినాశనానికే దారి తీస్తుంది. ప్రతిదీ సమతూకంలో ఉండాలి. అప్పుడే ఖర్చులు తగ్గి డబ్బులు మిగులుతాయి. అందుకు మా నినాదం ‘ఖర్చు తక్కువ దిగుబడి ఎక్కువ – తక్కువ పెట్టబడి ఎక్కువ పంట’. ఇదే మంత్రం జపించాలి, అనుసరించాలి. మనం మన వ్యవసాయంలో శాస్త్రీయమైన పద్ధతుల్లో వృద్ధి సాధించాలి. నీటి పరిరక్షణ కోసం ఏ చర్యలు తీసుకోవాలో మనం పూర్తి చిత్తశుద్ధితో ఆ చర్యలు తీసుకోవాలి. వర్షం కురిసేందుకు ఇంకా ఒకటి రెండు నెలల సమయం మాత్రమే ఉంది. ఈ లోపుగా మనం నీటి పరిరక్షణకు సిద్ధం కావాలి. ఎంత నీరు పొదుపు చేస్తే వ్యవసాయానికి అంత లాభం.. జీవితం అంత సౌకర్యవంతం.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశపు సాటి పౌరులారా.. ఏప్రిల్ 7న ప్రపంచ ఆరోగ్య దినోత్సవం. ఈ ఏడాది ఈ దినోత్సవం ప్రపంచమంతా ‘బీట్ డయాబెటిస్’ అనే ఇతివృత్తంతో కార్యక్రమాలు నిర్వహించనుంది. డయాబెటిస్ను ఓడిద్దాం… మధుమేహం ఇతర అనేక వ్యాధులకు మన శరీరంలో ఆతిథ్యమిచ్చేందుకు ఉత్సుకతతో ఉంటుంది. మన శరీరంలోకి అనేక ఇతర వ్యాధులు కురూపులైన అతిథులుగా మన శరీరం అనే ఇంట్లోకి చొరబడతాయి. 2014 నాటికి మన దేశంలో దాదాపు ఆరున్నర కోట్ల మంది మధుమేహం రోగులున్నారని అంచనా. మూడు శాతం మరణాలకు డయాబెటిస్ కారణమని తేలింది. డయాబెటిస్లో రెండు రకాలు టైప్-1, టైప్-2 అని. టైప్-1 వంశపారంపర్యంగా వస్తుంది. తల్లిదండ్రులకు ఉంటే పిల్లలకు వస్తుంది. టైప్-2 డయాబెటిస్ అలవాట్ల కారణంగా, వయస్సు కారణంగా, స్థూలకాయం కారణంగా వస్తుంది. అంటే మనమే దానిని స్వయంగా ఆహ్వానిస్తాం అన్నమాట. ప్రపంచమంతా డయాబెటిస్ వ్యాధి గురించి ఆందోళన చెందుతోంది. అందుకే ఏప్రిల్ 7న ప్రపంచ ఆరోగ్య దినోత్సవానికి ఈసారి డయాబెటిస్ పై పోరాటాన్ని ఇతివృత్తంగా నిర్ణయించారు.\nమన జీవనశైలి డయాబెటిస్ కు అతిపెద్ద కారణమని మనందరికీ తెలుసు. శారీరక శ్రమ తగ్గిపోతోంది. చెమట అనేది పట్టదు. అటూ ఇటూ తిరగడం అనేది జరగదు. ఆటలు ఆడటం అంటే ఆన్లైన్ గేమ్స్ మాత్రమే. ఆఫ్లైన్లో మాత్రం ఎటువంటి శ్రమ ఉండదు. మనం ఏప్రిల్ 7వ తేదీ నుంచి స్ఫూర్తి పొంది డయాబెటిస్ను ఓడించేందుకు మన వ్యక్తిగత జీవితాల్లో ఏదన్నా చేయగలమా? మీకు యోగా అంటే ఆసక్తి ఉంటే యోగా చేయండి. లేదా కనీసం నడక లేదా పరుగు ప్రాక్టీస్ చేయండి. నా ఈ భారతదేశంలో ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉంటే నా దేశం కూడా ఆరోగ్యంగానే ఉంటుంది కాదా. కొన్నిసార్లు మనం ఏదో సంకోచంతో వైద్య పరీక్షలు చేయించుకోం. పరిస్థితి బాగా క్షీణించాక అయ్యో! నాకు ఎప్పటి నుంచో డయాబెటిస్ ఉందే అనేది స్ఫురణకు వస్తుంది. పరీక్ష చేయించుకుంటే ఏం పోతుంది చెప్పండి. ఆ మాత్రం చేసుకోండి. ఇప్పుడు అన్ని సౌకర్యాలు అందుబాటులో ఉన్నాయి. ఎంతో తేలికగా ఈ పరీక్ష చేయించుకోవచ్చు. మీరు తప్పనిసరిగా ఈ విషయం ఆలోచించండి.\nమార్చి 24 నాడు ప్రపంచం క్షయ నివారణ దినోత్సవం జరుపుకొంటుంది. నా చిన్నప్పుడు టీబీ అనే పేరు వింటే భయపడిపోయేవారు తెలుసా. ఇంక చావు దగ్గరపడింది అనిపించేది. కానీ, ఇప్పుడు టీబీ అంటే భయం లేదు. ఎందుకంటే ఇప్పడు అందరికీ తెలుసు టీబీకి చికిత్స వీలవుతుందని. అతి తేలికగా చికిత్స జరుగుతుందని తెలుసు. టీబీ అంటే మరణం అనుకున్న రోజుల్లో భయపడేవాళ్లు ఇప్పడు చికిత్స ఉంది అనేసరికి నిర్లక్ష్యం పెరిగిపోయింది. కానీ, ప్రపంచవ్యాప్తంగా టీబీ రోగుల సంఖ్య ఇంకా ఎక్కువగానే ఉంది. క్షయ నుంచి విముక్తి కావాలి అంటే ఒకటి సరైన చికిత్స జరగాలి… రెండు సంపూర్ణ చికిత్స జరగాలి. కరెక్ట్ ట్రీట్మెంట్ – కంప్లీట్ ట్రీట్మెంట్; మధ్యలోనే విడిచిపెడితే కొత్త సమస్యలు వస్తాయి. పైగా టీబీ ఎలాంటి వ్యాధి అంటే చుట్టుపక్కల వారు, ఇరుగు పొరుగు వారు కూడా గుర్తిస్తారు. బాబూ పరీక్ష చేయించుకో టీబీ వచ్చి ఉంటుంది అంటారు. దగ్గు వస్తోంది. జ్వరం వస్తోంది. బరువు కూడా తగ్గిపోయింది. ఇవన్నీ చూసి చుట్టుపక్కల వారు ఇదిగో చూడండి. అతనికి టీబీ-వీబీ ఏవన్నా వచ్చిందేమో అంటారు. దీని అర్థం ఏంటంటే ఈ వ్యాధి ఎటువంటిది అంటే అతి త్వరగా పరీక్ష కూడా చేయించుకోవచ్చు అని.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశపు సాటి పౌరులారా… ఈ దిశలో ఎంతో కృషి జరుగుతోంది. మన దేశంలో 13 వేల 500 మందికి పైగా మైక్రోస్కోపీ కేంద్రాలున్నాయి. నాలుగు లక్షలకు పైగా డాట్ సేవలు అందించే వారు ఉన్నారు. ఎన్నో ఆధునిక లేబొరేటరీలు ఉన్నాయి. ఈ పరీక్ష ఉచితంగా జరుగుతుంది కూడా. మీరు ఒక్కసారి పరీక్ష చేయించుకోండి. ఈ రోగం మానిపోతుంది. చేయవలసిందల్లా సరైన చికిత్స పొందడం, వ్యాధి పూర్తిగా నయమయ్యే వరకు చికిత్స కొనసాగించడం. టీబీ కానివ్వండి, డయాబెటిస్ కానివ్వండి. నాది ఒకటే విజ్ఞప్తి. మనం ఈ వ్యాధులను పారద్రోలాలి. మన దేశాన్ని ఈ వ్యాధుల నుంచి విముక్తం చేయాలి. కానీ, మీరు తలచుకోనిదే ఈ పని ప్రభుత్వం, వైద్యులు, మందుల వల్ల కాదు. అందుకే దేశవాసులకు నా విజ్ఞప్తి. డయాబెటిస్ను ఓడిద్దాం. టీబీ నుంచి విముక్తిని పొందుదాం.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశపు సాటి పౌరులారా.. ఏప్రిల్ నెలలో కొన్ని ముఖ్యమైన సందర్భాలు ఉన్నాయి. ముఖ్యంగా ఏప్రిల్ 14న బాబా సాహెబ్ భీమ్ రావ్ అంబేడ్కర్ జయంతి. ఆయన 125వ జయంతి వేడుకలు ఏడాది మొత్తం జరిగాయి. మహావ్ లో ఆయన జన్మ స్థలం, లండన్లో ఆయన విద్యాభ్యాసం, నాగ్పూర్లో ఆయన దీక్ష, ఢిల్లీలో 26, అలీపూర్ రోడ్లో ఆయన కాలం చేసిన ఇల్లు, ముంబైలో ఆయన అంత్యక్రియలు జరిగిన చైత్యభూమి.. ఈ పంచతీర్థాల్లో అభివృద్ధి కోసం మనం నిరంతరం ప్రయత్నం చేస్తున్నాం. ఈ ఏడాది ఏప్రిల్ 14న ఆయన స్వస్థలమైన మహావ్ ను సందర్శించే భాగ్యం నాకు కలిగింది. ఒక ఉత్తమ పౌరుడిగా మారేందుకు బాబా సాహెబ్ మనకు ఎంతో ప్రేరణ కలిగించారు. ఎంతో స్ఫూర్తి ఇచ్చారు. ఆయన మార్గంలో ఒక మంచి పౌరుడిగా మారడం ద్వారా మనం ఆయనకు ఘనమైన రీతిలో శ్రద్ధాంజలిని ఘటించగలుగుతాం.\nమరి కొద్ది రోజుల్లోనే విక్రమ సంవత్ నూతన సంవత్సరం ప్రారంభమవుతుంది. దానిని వేర్వేరు రాష్ట్రాలలో వేర్వేరు రూపాలలో జరుపుకొంటారు. కొంత మంది దీనిని కొత్త సంవత్సరం అంటారు. మరి కొంత మంది గుడిపడ్వని, మరి కొందరు వర్ష్ ప్రతిపద అని పిలుస్తారు. మరి కొందరు ఉగాది అని పిలుస్తారు. అయితే, భారత దేశంలో ఇంచుమించు అన్ని ప్రాంతాల్లో దీనికి ప్రత్యేకత ఉంది. కొత్త ఏడాది మంగళప్రదమైన వేళ అందరికీ అనేకానేక శుభాకాంక్షలు.\nమీకు తెలుసు నేను గతంలో కూడా చెప్పాను. నా ‘మన్కీ బాత్’ వినాలనుకుంటే ఎప్పుడైనా వినవచ్చు అని. సుమారు 20 భాషలలో దీనిని వినవచ్చు. మీరు మీకు వీలున్నప్పుడే వినవచ్చు. మీరు మీ మొబైల్ ఫోన్లో వినవచ్చు. ఇందుకు కేవలం ఒక మిస్డ్ కాల్ చేయవలసి ఉంటుంది. ఈ సేవ ఇప్పుడే నెల రోజుల క్రితమే ప్రారంభమైంది. కానీ, 35 లక్షల మంది దీనిని వినియోగించుకున్నారు. మీరు కూడా నంబర్ రాసుకోండి. 81908 – 81908. ఈ నంబర్ మళ్లీ చెప్తాను. 81908 – 81908. మీరు మిస్డ్ కాల్ చేయండి. ఎప్పుడైనా మీకు వీలుంటే అప్పుడు పాత ‘మన్ కీ బాత్’లు వినవచ్చు. మీరు మీ భాషల్లోనే వినవచ్చు. మీతో ఇలా కలసి ఉండటం అంటే నాకు ఎంతో సంతోషంగా ఉంటుంది.\nప్రియమైన నా దేశపు సాటి పౌరులారా… మీకు నా హృదయ పూర్వక శుభాకాంక్షలు; అనేకానేక ధన్యవాదాలు.\n\n\n"

I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.\nSome of my young friends must be busy with their examinations. Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other. I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.\nSome days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup. Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.\nWith the young comprising 65% of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports. This won’t do. We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports. We can see that happening in India. As with Cricket, there’s now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.\nYou must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year. Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country. The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics. Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs. Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.\nOn the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches. Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television. What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility? Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?\nWe should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India. Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football. If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host. So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley. Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth. One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities. But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.\nFriends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage. How should this event be? What kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum? How should it be publicised? What improvements do we need to make? How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup? How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game?\nWe can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well. The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so. Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity? I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level. I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match. In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.\nI look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp. Do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans. How should we propagate this throughout India? What should the songs be like? What should be in the souvenirs? Think about it friends. I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup. You should robustly participate in this event. It’s a golden chance to build India’s image.\nMy dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays. There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so. Some people also go outside their states. Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit. And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists. Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.\nWe have to take this task forward. Do it this time as well. But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess. One gets to learn a lot by visiting new places. Things we can’t learn in a classroom, within our family, from our friends, sometimes we can learn those things by travelling. We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles. Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”. “If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.” India is full of diversities. Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it. I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel. When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot. Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.\nTravel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives. These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity. Unlike before, they don’t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new. I see this as a good sign. Our youth should be bold. They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.\nIn this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India. Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit. Generally we don’t think of coal mines as places to be visited. When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there. We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines. But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism. This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur. This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.\nI hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too. There is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter-free. Both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it. Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done. Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations? I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.\nTourism is a sector that provides maximum employment. Even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism. When tourists visit a place, even the not-so-well-off among them spend money. Rich tourists are bound to spend more money. There are many employment opportunities created by tourism. India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world. But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world. We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India. Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen. Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.\nMy dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away. You too should think along these lines. Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that? I will give you something to ponder upon. Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays? If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays? If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays? Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?” There are so many skills to develop our personality. Why not learn them? Why not overcome some of our shortcomings? Why not add to our strengths? Do give it a thought.\nIt is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this. You can find something around you. Let’s say you decide to make the ‘best’ out of ‘waste’. Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it. You will enjoy it. By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish. Suppose you are fond of painting and you don’t know how to paint. Just start painting and gradually you will get better at it. You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill. There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you. This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously. Just try it for yourself. When you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays, and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new, they will realise that they wasted their time. They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.” This will perhaps become a big thing among friends. I am confident that you will surely do it and, yes, do share with me what you have learned.\nThis time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –\nSound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi. Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water. I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds. I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat. Thank You.”\nMy dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi. He called me up and reminded me of what I had said. Frankly, I had forgotten about it. And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.\nFriends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi. He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me. Last summer I had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers. Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends. The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds. She wrote this in one of her poems, “We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water…” Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do. I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.\nShilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue. She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes. Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes. Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days? Have we ever given them water to drink? Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner. It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good. Of course, it is a part of our nature in India. But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India. Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities. No, it’s not like that. You will be happy to learn that a ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ has been launched to serve your interests. If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips. There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides. Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts. If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you. I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones. Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you? If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more. A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste. For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance. We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water. Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted. Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected? If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced. But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.\nYou must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs. Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation. Every village should save water. How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains? How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village? You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a people’s movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation. There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work. But we still need to do much more in this direction.\nMy dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’. There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture. But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields. Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed. I welcome this. Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering? When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste. But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food? The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it? The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.\nNo matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination. There should be a balance in everything. This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money. Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More. We should move forward with this ‘mantra’ and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods. I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation. We have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon. Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.\nMy dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is ‘Beat Diabetes’. I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases. Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it. It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics. Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths. Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child. Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity. The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.\nWe all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes. Physical labour is getting reduced. There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around. Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline. Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life? If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga. Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run. If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy. Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done. When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame. What do you lose in getting a check-up done? Please get this much done at least. Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily. Please do be concerned about this.\nOn March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day. When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB. It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease. But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured. Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it. Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients. If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment. If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us. Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot. “Oh look! You have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight. Go get it checked. You must have got TB.” This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.\nMy dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction. There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories. And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done. This disease can be got rid of. All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely. I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these. We have to eradicate these diseases from India. But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it. So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.\nMy dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country. The five pilgrimage spots associated with him – Mhow, his birthplace; London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his ‘Deeksha’; 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode; and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed. We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots. I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year. Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens. We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.\nIn a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin. It is celebrated in different states in different forms. Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India. My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.\nAs you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to. You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it. You can listen to it on your own mobile handset. All you have to do is to give a missed call. I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it. You too can note down the number. 81908-81908. I repeat – 81908-81908. Give a missed call on this number whenever it is convenient for you. Even if you wish to listen to any previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in the language of your choice. I will be happy to remain connected with you.\nMy dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all. Many, many thanks.\n"
