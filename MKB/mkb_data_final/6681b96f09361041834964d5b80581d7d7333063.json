      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

      "text": "\nनमस्कार। मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! आज फिर एक बार ‘मन की बात’ के इस कार्यक्रम में आप सबके साथ रूबरू होने का सौभाग्य मिला है। अभी कुछ दिन पहले बेंगलुरु में एक ऐतिहासिक क्रिकेट मैच हुआ। आप लोग भली-भांति समझ गए होंगे कि मैं भारत और अफगानिस्तान के टेस्ट मैच की बात कर रहा हूँ। यह अफगानिस्तान का पहला अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय मैच था और यह हर भारतीय के लिए गर्व की बात है कि अफगानिस्तान का यह ऐतिहासिक मैच भारत के साथ था। इस मैच में दोनों ही टीमों ने बेहतरीन प्रदर्शन किया और दूसरे अफगानिस्तान के ही एक बॉलर राशिद खान ने तो इस वर्ष IPL में भी काफ़ी अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया था और मुझे याद है कि अफगानिस्तान के राष्ट्रपति श्रीमान अशरफ़ गनी ने मुझे tag कर अपने twitter पर लिखा था– “अफगानिस्तानके लोगों को अपने हीरो राशिद खान पर अत्यंत गर्व है” मैं हमारे भारतीय मित्रों का भी आभारी हूँ, जिन्होंने हमारे खिलाड़ियों को अपना कौशल दिखाने के लिए एक platform प्रदान किया है। अफगानिस्तान में जो श्रेष्ठ है राशिद उसका प्रतिनिधित्व करता है। वह cricket की दुनिया का asset है और इसके साथ-साथ उन्होंने थोड़ा मजाकिये अंदाज़ में ये भी लिखा –“नहीं हम उसे किसी को देने वाले नहीं हैं ।” यह मैच हम सभी के लिए एक यादगार रहेगा। खैर ये पहला मैच था इसलिए याद रहना तो बहुत स्वाभाविक है लेकिन मुझे ये मैच किसी एक विशेष कारण से याद रहेगा। भारतीय टीम ने कुछ ऐसा किया,जो पूरे विश्व के लिए एक मिसाल है। भारतीय टीम ने ट्रॉफी लेते समय एक विजेता टीम क्या कर सकती है – उन्होंने क्या किया!-भारतीय टीम ने ट्रॉफी लेते समय, अफगानिस्तान की टीम जो कि पहली बार अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय मैच खेल रही थी,अफगानिस्तान की टीम को आमंत्रित किया और दोनों टीमों ने साथ में फोटो ली। sportsman spirit क्या होता है, sportsmanship क्या होती है – इस एक घटना से हम अनुभव कर सकते हैं। खेल समाज को एकजुट करने और हमारे युवाओं का जो कौशल है,उनमें जो प्रतिभा है, उसे खोज निकालने का एक बेहरतीन तरीक़ा है। भारत और अफगानिस्तान दोनों टीमों को मेरी शुभकामनाएँ हैं। मुझे उम्मीद है हम आगे भी इसी तरह एक-दूसरे के साथ पूरे sportsman spirit के साथ खेलेंगे भी, खिलेंगे भी।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! इस 21 जून को चौथे ‘योग दिवस’ पर एक अलग ही नज़ारा था। पूरी दुनिया एकजुट नज़र आयी। विश्व-भर में लोगों ने पूरे उत्साह और उमंग के साथ योगाभ्यास किया। Brussels में European Parliament हो,New York स्थित संयुक्तराष्ट्र का मुख्यालय हो, जापानी नौ-सेना के लड़ाकू जहाज़ हों, सभी जगह लोग योग करते नज़र आए। सऊदी अरब में पहली बार योग का ऐतिहासिक कार्यक्रम हुआ और मुझे बताया गया है कि बहुत सारे आसनों का demonstration तो महिलाओं ने किया। लद्दाख की ऊँची बर्फीली चोटियों पर भारत और चीन के सैनिकों ने एक-साथ मिलकर के योगाभ्यास किया। योग सभी सीमाओं को तोड़कर,जोड़ने का काम करता है। सैकड़ों देशों के हजारों उत्साही लोगों ने जाति, धर्म, क्षेत्र, रंग या लिंग हर प्रकार के भेद से परे जाकर इस अवसर को एक बहुत बड़ा उत्सव बना दिया। यदि दुनिया भर के लोग इतने उत्साहित होकर ‘योग दिवस’ के कार्यक्रमों में भाग ले रहे थे तो भारत में इसका उत्साह अनेक गुना क्यों नहीं होगा।\nदेश को गर्व होता है, जब सवा-सौ करोड़ लोग देखते हैं कि हमारे देश के सुरक्षा बल के जवान, जल-थल और नभ तीनों जगह योग का अभ्यास किया। कुछ वीर सैनिकों ने जहाँ पनडुब्बी में योग किया, वहीं कुछ सैनिकों ने सियाचीन के बर्फीले पहाड़ों पर योगाभ्यास किया। वायुसेना के हमारे योद्धाओं ने तो बीच आसमान में धरती से 15 हज़ार फुट की ऊंचाई पर योगासन करके सबको स्तब्ध कर दिया। देखने वाला नज़ारा यह था कि उन्होंने हवा में तैरते हुए किया, न कि हवाई जहाज़ में बैठकर के। स्कूल हो, कॉलेज हो, दफ्तर हो, पार्क हो, ऊँची ईमारत हो या खेल का मैदान हो, सभी जगह योगाभ्यास हुआ। अहमदाबाद का एक दृश्य तो दिल को छू लेने वाला था। वहाँ पर लगभग 750 दिव्यांग भाई-बहनों ने एक स्थान पर, एक साथ इकट्ठे योगाभ्यास करके विश्व कीर्तिमान बना डाला। योग ने जाति, पंथ और भूगोल से परे जाकर विश्व भर के लोगों को एकजुट होकर करने का काम किया है। ‘वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्’ के जिस भाव को हम सदियों से जीते आये हैं। हमारे ऋषि, मुनि, संत जिस पर हमेशा जोर देते हैं, योग ने उसे सही मायने में सिद्ध करके दिखाया है। मैं मानता हूँ कि आज योग एक wellness, revolution का काम कर रहा है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि योग से wellness की जो एक मुहीम चली है, वो आगे बढ़ेगी। अधिक से अधिक लोग इसे अपने जीवन का हिस्सा बनायेंगे।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो!MyGov और NarendraModiApp पर कई लोगों ने मुझे लिखा है कि मैं इस बार की ‘मन की बात’ में 1 जुलाई को आने वाले Doctor’s Day के बारे में बात करूँ – सही बात है। हम मुसीबत के समय ही डॉक्टर को याद करते हैं लेकिन यह एक ऐसा दिन है, जब देश हमारे डॉक्टर्स की उपलब्धियों को celebrate करता है और समाज के प्रति उनकी सेवा और समर्पण के लिए उन्हें बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद देता है। हम वो लोग हैं,जो स्वाभवतः माँ को भगवान के रूप में पूजते हैं, भगवान के बराबर मानते हैं क्योंकि माँ हमें जीवन देती है, माँ हमें जन्म देती है, तो कई बार डॉक्टर हमें पुनर्जन्म देता है। डॉक्टर की भूमिका केवल बीमारियों का इलाज़ करने तक सीमित नहीं है। अक्सर डॉक्टर परिवार के मित्र की तरह होते हैं। हमारे life style guides हैं – “They not only cure but also heal”। आज डॉक्टर के पास medical expertise तो होती ही है,साथ ही उनके पास general life style trends के बारे में, उसका हमारे स्वास्थ्य पर क्या प्रभाव पड़ता है, इन सबके बारे में गहरा अनुभव होता है। भारतीय डॉक्टरों ने अपनी क्षमता और कौशल से पूरे विश्व में अपनी पहचान बनायी है। medical profession में महारत,hardworking के साथ-साथ हमारे डॉक्टर complex medical problems को solve करने के लिए जाने जाते हैं। ‘मन की बात’ के माध्यम से मैं सभी देशवासियों की तरफ़ से हमारे सभी डॉक्टर साथियों को आगामी 1 जुलाई को आने वाले ‘Doctor’s Day’ की ढेरों शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! हम ऐसे भाग्यवान लोग हैं जिनका इस भारत भूमि में जन्म हुआ है। भारत का एक ऐसा समृद्ध इतिहास रहा है, जब कोई ऐसा महीना नहीं है, कोई ऐसा दिन नहीं है, जिसमें कोई–न-कोई ऐतिहासिक घटना न घटी हो। देखें तो भारत में हर जगह की अपनी एक विरासत है। वहाँ से जुड़ा कोई संत है, कोई महापुरुष है, कोई प्रसिद्ध व्यक्ति है, सभी का अपना-अपना योगदान है, अपना महात्म्य है।\n“प्रधानमंत्री जी नमस्कार! मैं डॉ. सुरेन्द्र मिश्र बोल रहा हूँ। हमें ज्ञात हुआ है कि 28 जून को आप मगहर आ रहे हैं। मैं मगहर के ही बगल में एक छोटे से गाँव टडवा, जो गोरखपुर में है, वहाँ का रहने वाला हूँ। मगहरकबीर की समाधि स्थली है और कबीर को लोग यहाँ पर सामाजिक समरसता के लिए याद रखते हैं और कबीर के विचारों पर हर स्तर पर चर्चा होती है। आपकी कार्ययोजना से इस दिशा में समाज के सभी स्तरों पर काफ़ी प्रभाव होगा। आपसे प्रार्थना है कि कृपया भारत सरकार की जो कार्ययोजना है, उसके बारे में अवगत करवाने की कृपा करें ।”\nआपके फ़ोन कॉल के लिए बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद। ये सही है कि मैं 28 तारीख़ को मगहर आ रहा हूँ और वैसे भी जब मैं गुजरात में था, गुजरात का कबीरवड तो आप भलीभांति जानते हैं। जब मैं वहाँ काम करता था तो मैंने एक संत कबीर की परंपरा से जुड़े लोगों का एक बड़ा, एक राष्ट्रीय अधिवेशन भी किया था। आप लोग जानते हैं, कबीरदास जी मगहर क्यों गए थे ? उस समय एक धारणा थी कि मगहर में जिसकी मृत्यु होती है, वह स्वर्ग नहीं जाता। इसके उलट काशी में जो शरीर त्याग करता है, वो स्वर्ग जाता है। मगहर को अपवित्र माना जाता था लेकिन संत कबीरदास इस पर विश्वास नहीं करते थे। अपने समय की ऐसी ही कुरीतियाँ और अंधविश्वासों को उन्होंने तोड़ने का काम किया और इसलिए वे मगहर गए और वहीँ उन्होंने समाधि ली। संत कबीरदास जी ने अपनी साखियों और दोहों के माध्यम से सामाजिक समानता, शांति और भाईचारे पर बल दिया। यही उनके आदर्श थे। उनकी रचनाओं में हमें यही आदर्श देखने को मिलते हैं और आज के युग में भी वे उतने ही प्रेरक है। उनका एक दोहा है:-\n“कबीर सोई पीर है, जो जाने पर पीर |\nजो पर पीर न जानही, सो का पीर में पीर ||\nमतलब सच्चा पीर संत वही है जो दूसरो की पीड़ा को जानता और समझता है, जो दूसरे के दुःख को नहीं जानते वे निष्ठुर हैं। कबीरदास जी ने सामाजिक समरसता पर विशेष जोर दिया था। वे अपने समय से बहुत आगे सोचते थे। उस समय जब विश्व में अवनति और संघर्ष का दौर चल रहा था उन्होंने शांति और सद्भाव का सन्देश दिया और लोकमानस को एकजुट करके मतभेदों को दूर करने का काम किया |\n“जग में बैरी कोई नहीं, जो मन शीतल होय |\nयह आपा तो डाल दे, दया करे सब कोय |।”\nएक अन्य दोहे में कबीर लिखते हैं –\n“जहां दया तहं धर्म है, जहां लोभ तहं पाप |\nजहां क्रोध तहं काल है, जहां क्षमा तहं आप |।”\nउन्होंने कहा:-\n“जाति न पूछो साधू की, पूछ लीजिये ज्ञान |\nऔर लोगों से अपील की वे धर्म और जाति से ऊपर उठ कर लोगों को ज्ञान के आधार पर मानें, उनका सम्मान करें, उनकी बातें आज सदियों बाद भी उतनी ही प्रभावी है। अभी जब हम संत कबीरदास जी के बारे में बात कर रहे हैं तो मुझे उनका एक दोहा याद आता है। जिसमें वो कहते हैं:-\n“गुरु गोविन्द दोऊ खड़े, काके लागूं पांय |\nबलिहारी गुरु आपने, गोविन्द दियो बताय |।”\nऐसी होती है ये गुरु की महानता और ऐसे ही एक गुरु हैं, जगतगुरु – गुरु नानक देव। जिन्होंने कोटि-कोटि लोगों को सन्मार्ग दिखाया, सदियों से प्रेरणा देते रहें। गुरु नानक देव ने समाज में जातिगत भेदभाव को ख़त्म करने और पूरे मानवजाति को एक मानते हुए उन्हें गले लगाने की शिक्षा दी। गुरु नानक देव कहते थे गरीबों और जरुरतमंदों की सेवा ही भगवान की सेवा है। वे जहाँ भी गए उन्होंने समाज की भलाई के लिए कई पहल की। सामाजिक भेदभाव से मुक्त रसोई की व्यवस्था जहाँ हर जाति, पंथ, धर्म या सम्प्रदाय का व्यक्ति आकर खाना खा सकता था। गुरु नानक देव ने ही तो इस लंगर व्यवस्था की शुरुआत की। 2019 में गुरु नानक देव जी का 550वाँ प्रकाश पर्व मनाया जाएगा। मैं चाहता हूँ हम सब लोग उत्साह और उमंग के साथ इससे जुड़े। आप लोगो से भी मेरा आग्रह गुरु नानक देव जी के 550वें प्रकाश पर्व पर पूरे समाज में और विश्वभर में इसे कैसे मनाया जाए, नए-नए ideas क्या हों, नए-नए सुझाव क्या हों, नई-नई कल्पनाएँ क्या हों, उस पर हम सोचें, तैयारियाँ करें और बड़े गौरव के साथ उसको हम सब, इस प्रकाश पर्व को प्रेरणा पर्व भी बनाएं |\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! भारत की आज़ादी का संघर्ष बहुत लम्बा है, बहुत व्यापक है, बहुत गहरा है, अनगिनत शाहदतों से भरा हुआ है। पंजाब से जुड़ा एक और इतिहास है। 2019 में जलियांवाला बाग़ की उस भयावह घटना के भी 100 साल पूरे हो रहे हैं जिसने पूरी मानवता को शर्मसार कर दिया था। 13 अप्रैल, 1919 का वो काला दिन कौन भूल सकता है जब power का दुरुपयोग करते हुए क्रूरता की सारी हदें पारकर निर्दोष, निहत्थे और मासूम लोगों पर गोलियाँ चलाई गयी थी। इस घटना के 100 वर्ष पूरे होने वाले हैं। इसे हम कैसे स्मरण करें, हम सब इस पर सोच सकते हैं, लेकिन इस घटना ने जो अमर सन्देश दिया, उसे हम हमेशा याद रखें। ये हिंसा और क्रूरता से कभी किसी समस्या का समाधान नहीं किया जा सकता। जीत हमेशा शांति और अहिंसा की होती है, त्याग और बलिदान की होती है।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! दिल्ली के रोहिणी के श्रीमान रमण कुमार ने ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ पर लिखा है कि आने वाली 6 जुलाई को डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी का जन्मदिन है और वे चाहते हैं इस कार्यक्रम में डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी के बारे में देशवासियों से बात करूँ। रमण जी सबसे पहले तो आपको बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद। भारत के इतिहास में आपकी रूचि देखकर काफ़ी अच्छा लगा। आप जानते हैं, कल ही डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी की पुण्यतिथि थी 23, जून को। डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी कई क्षेत्रों से जुड़े रहे लेकिन जो क्षेत्र उनके सबसे करीब रहे वे थे education, administration और parliamentary affairs,बहुत कम लोगों को पता होगा कि वे कोलकाता विश्वविद्यालय के सबसे कम उम्र के Vice Chancellor थे। जब वे Vice Chancellor बने थे तब उनकी उम्र मात्र 33 वर्ष थी। बहुत कम लोग ये जानते होंगे कि 1937 में डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी के निमंत्रण पर श्री गुरुदेव रवीन्द्रनाथ टैगोर ने कोलकाता विश्वविद्यालय में convocation को बांग्ला भाषा में संबोधित किया था। यह पहला अवसर था, जब अंग्रेजों की सल्तनत थी और कोलकाता विश्वविद्यालय में किसी ने बांग्ला भाषा में convocation को संबोधित किया था। 1947 से 1950 तक डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी भारत के पहले उद्योग मंत्री रहे और एक अर्थ में कहें तो उन्होंने भारत का औद्योगिक विकास का मज़बूत शिलान्यास किया था, मज़बूत base तैयार किया था, एक मज़बूत platform तैयार किया था। 1948 में आई स्वतंत्र भारत की पहली औद्योगिक नीति उनके ideas और visions की छाप लेकर के आई थी। डॉ० मुखर्जी का सपना था भारत हर क्षेत्र में औद्योगिक रूप से आत्मनिर्भर हो, कुशल और समृद्ध हो। वे चाहते थे कि भारत बड़े उद्योगों को develop करे और साथ ही MSMEs,हथकरघा, वस्त्र और कुटीर उद्योग पर भी पूरा ध्यान दे। कुटीर और लघु उद्योगों के समुचित विकास के लिए उन्हें finance और organization setup मिले, इसके लिए 1948 से 1950 के बीच All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board और Khadi & Village Industries Board की स्थापना की गई थी। डॉ० मुखर्जी का भारत के रक्षा उत्पादन के स्वदेशीकरण पर भी विशेष ज़ोर था। Chittaranjan Locomotive Works Factory, Hindustan Aircraft Factory, सिंदरी का खाद कारखाना और दामोदर घाटी निगम, ये चार सबसे सफ़ल और बड़े projectsऔर दूसरे river valley projects की स्थापना में डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी का बहुत बड़ा योगदान था। पश्चिम बंगाल के विकास को लेकर वे काफ़ी passionate थे। उनकी समझ, विवेक और सक्रियता का ही परिणाम है कि बंगाल का एक हिस्सा बचाया जा सका और वह आज भी भारत का हिस्सा है। डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी के लिए, जो सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात थी, वो थी भारत की अखंडता और एकता – और इसी के लिए 52 साल की कम उम्र में हीउन्होंने अपनी जान भी गवानी पड़ी। आइये! हम हमेशा डॉ० श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी के एकता के सन्देश को याद रखें, सद्भाव और भाईचारे की भावना के साथ, भारत की प्रगति के लिए जी-जान से जुटे रहें।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! पिछले कुछ सप्ताह में मुझे video call के माध्यम से सरकार की विभिन्न योजनाओं के लाभार्थियों से संवाद करने का अवसर मिला। फाइलों से परे जाकर लोगों की life में जो बदलाव आ रहे हैं, उनके बारे में सीधा उन्हीं से जानने का अवसर मिला। लोगों ने अपने संकल्प, अपने सुख-दुःख, अपनी उपलब्धियों के बारे में बताया। मैं मानता हूँ कि मेरे लिए यह महज एक सरकारी कार्यक्रम नहीं था बल्कि यह एक अलग तरह का learning experience था और इस दौरान लोगों के चेहरे पर जो खुशियाँ देखने को मिली, उससे बड़ा संतोष का पल किसी की भी ज़िन्दगी में क्या हो सकता है? जब एक सामान्य मानवी(मानव) की कहानियाँ सुनता था। उनके भोले-भाले शब्द अपने अनुभव की कथा वो जो कह रहे थे, दिल को छू जाती थी। दूर-सुदूर गांवों में बेटियाँ common service centre के माध्यम से गांवों के बुज़ुर्गों की pension से लेकर passport बनवाने तक की सेवाएँ उपलब्ध करवा रही हैं। जब छत्तीसगढ़ की कोई बहन सीताफल को collect कर उसकी ice-cream बनाकर व्यवसाय करती हो। झारखंड में अंजन प्रकाश की तरह देश के लाखों युवा-जन औषधि केंद्र चलाने के साथ-साथ आस-पास के गावों में जाकर सस्ती दवाइयाँ उपलब्ध करवा रहे हों। वहीं पश्चिम बंगाल का कोई नौजवान दो-तीन साल पहले नौकरी ढूंढ रहा हो और अब वह केवल अपना सफल व्यवसाय कर रहा है; इतना ही नहीं, दस-पंद्रह लोगों को और नौकरी भी दे रहा है। इधर तमिलनाडु, पंजाब, गोवा के स्कूल के छात्र अपनी छोटी उम्र में स्कूल की tinkering lab में waste management जैसे important topic पर काम कर रहे हों। न जाने कितनी-कितनी कहानियाँ थी। देश का कोई कोना ऐसा नहीं होगा जहाँ लोगों को अपनी सफलता की बात कहनी न हो। मुझे खुशी इस बात की है इस पूरे कार्यक्रम में सरकार की सफलता से ज़्यादा सामान्य मानवी (मानव) की सफलता की बातें देश की शक्ति, नए भारत के सपनों की शक्ति, नए भारत के संकल्प की शक्ति – इसे मैं अनुभव कर रहा था। समाज में कुछ लोग होते हैं। वह जब तक निराशा की बातें न करें, हताशा की बातें न करें, अविश्वास पैदा करने का प्रयास न करें, जोड़ने के बजाय तोड़ने के रास्ते न खोजें, तब तक उनको चैन नहीं होता है। ऐसे वातावरण में सामान्य मानवी (मानव) जब नई आशा, नया उमंग और अपने जीवन में घटी घटनाओं की बात लेकर के आता है तो वह सरकार का श्रेय नहीं होता। दूर-सुदूर एक छोटे से गाँव की छोटी सी बालिका की घटना भी सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के लिए प्रेरणा बन जाती है। मेरे लिए technology की मदद से, video bridge के माध्यम से लाभार्थियों के साथ समय बिताने का एक पल बहुत ही सुखद, बहुत ही प्रेरक रहा है और इससे कार्य करने का संतोष तो मिलता ही है लेकिन और अधिक कार्य करने का उत्साह भी मिलता है। ग़रीब से ग़रीब व्यक्ति के लिए ज़िन्दगी खपाने का एक और नया आनंद, एक और नया उत्साह, एक और नई प्रेरणा प्राप्त होती है। मैं देशवासियों का बहुत आभारी हूँ। 40-40, 50-50लाख लोग इस video bridge के कार्यक्रम में जुड़े और मुझे नई ताक़त देने का काम आपने किया। मैं फिर एक बार आप सबका आभार व्यक्त करना चाहता हूँ |\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! मैं हमेशा अनुभव करता हूँ, अगर हम हमारे आस-पास देखें तो कहीं-न-कहीं कुछ-न-कुछ अच्छा होता है। अच्छा करने वाले लोग होते हैं। अच्छाई की सुगंध हम भी अनुभव कर सकते हैं। पिछले दिनों एक बात मेरे ध्यान में आई और यह बड़ा अनोखा combination है। इसमें एक तरफ़ जहाँ professionals और engineers हैं वहीं दूसरी तरफ खेत में काम करने वाले, खेती से जुड़े हमारे किसान भाई-बहन हैं। अब आप सोच रहें होंगे कि यह तो दो बिल्कुल अलग-अलग व्यवसाय हैं – इनका क्या संबंध? लेकिन ऐसा है, बेंगलुरु में corporate professionals, IT engineers साथ आये। उन्होंने मिलकर के एक सहज ‘समृद्धि ट्रस्ट’ बनाया है और उन्होंने किसानों की आय दोगुनी हो, इसके लिए इस ट्रस्ट को activate किया। किसानों से जुड़ते गए, योजनाएँ बनाते गए और किसानों की आय बढ़ाने के लिए सफल प्रयास करते रहे। खेती के नए गुण सिखाने के साथ-साथ जैविक खेती कैसे की जाए? खेतों में एक फसल के साथ-साथ और भी फसल कैसे उगाई जाए? ये ट्रस्ट के द्वारा इन professional, engineer, technocratकेद्वाराकिसानों को training दी जाने लगी। पहले जो किसान अपने खेतों में एक ही फसल पर निर्भर हुआ करते थे। उपज भी अच्छी नहीं होती थी और मुनाफ़ा भी ज़्यादा नहीं होता था। आज वह न केवल सब्जियाँ उगा रहें हैं और बल्कि अपनी सब्जियों की marketing भी ट्रस्ट के माध्यम से कर के, अच्छे दाम पा रहे हैं। अनाज़ उत्पादन करने वाले किसान भी इससे जुड़ें हुए हैं। एक तरफ फसल के उत्पाद से लेकर के marketing तक पूरी chain में किसानों की एक प्रमुख भूमिका है तो दूसरी तरफ मुनाफ़े में किसानों की भागीदारी सुनिश्चित उनका हक़ सुनिश्चित करने का प्रयास है। फसल अच्छी हो, उसके लिए अच्छी नस्ल की बीजें हों। इसके लिए अलग सीड-बैंक बनाया गया है। महिलाएँ इस सीड-बैंक का कामकाज देखती हैं। महिलाओं को भी जोड़ा गया है। मैं इन युवाओं को इस अभिनव प्रयोग के लिए बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ और मुझे खुशी है कि professionals,technocrat, engineering की दुनिया से जुड़ेइन नौजवानों ने अपने दायरे से बाहर निकल कर के किसान के साथ जुड़ना, गाँव के साथ जुड़ना, खेत और खलिहान के साथ जुड़ने का जो रास्ता अपनाया है। मैं फिर एक बार मेरे देश की युवा-पीढ़ी को उनके इस अभिनव प्रयोगों, को कुछ जो शायद मैंने जाना होगा, कुछ नहीं जाना होगा, कुछ लोगों को पता होगा, कुछ पता नहीं होगा लेकिन निरंतर कोटि-कोटि लोग कुछ-न-कुछ अच्छा कर रहे हैं, उन सबको मेरी तरफ से बहुत-बहुत शुभकामना हैं।\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो!GST को एक साल पूरा होने वाला है ‘One Nation, One Tax’ देश के लोगों का सपना था, वो आज हक़ीक़त में बदल चुका है। One Nation One Tax reform,इसके लिए अगर मुझे सबसे ज्यादा किसी को credit देनी है तो मैं राज्यों को credit देता हूँ। GST Cooperative federalism का एक बेहतरीन उदाहरण है, जहाँ सभी राज्यों ने मिलकर देशहित में फ़ैसला लिया और तब जाकर देश में इतना बड़ा tax reform लागू हो सका। अब तक GST Councilकी 27 meeting हुई हैं और हम सब गर्व कर सकते हैं कि भिन्न-भिन्न राजनीतिक विचारधारा के लोग वहाँ बैठते हैं, भिन्न-भिन्न राज्यों के लोग बैठते हैं, अलग-अलग priority वालेराज्य होते हैं लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी GST Council में अब तक जितने भी निर्णय किये गए हैं, वे सारे के सारे सर्वसहमति से किये गए हैं। GST से पहले देश में 17 अलग-अलग प्रकार के tax हुआ करते थे लेकिन इस व्यवस्था में अब सिर्फ़ एक ही tax पूरे देश में लागू है। GST ईमानदारी की जीत है और ईमानदारी का एक उत्सव भी है। पहले देश में काफ़ी बार tax के मामले में इंस्पेक्टरराज की शिकायतें आती रहती थी। GST मेंइंस्पेक्टर की जगह IT ने information technology ने ले ली है। return से लेकर refund तक सब कुछ online information technology के द्वारा होता है। GST के आने से check post ख़त्म हो गई और माल सामानों की आवाजाही तेज़ हो गई, जिससे न सिर्फ़ समय बच रहा है बल्कि logistics क्षेत्र में भी इसका काफ़ी लाभ मिल रहा है। GST शायद दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा tax reform होगा। भारत में इतना बड़ा tax reform सफ़ल इसलिए हो पाया क्योंकि देश के लोगों ने इसे अपनाया और जन-शक्ति के द्वारा ही GST की सफ़लता सुनिश्चित हो सकी। आमतौर पर ऐसा माना जाता है कि इतना बड़ा reform, इतना बड़ा देश, इतनी बड़ी जनसंख्या इसको पूर्ण रूप से स्थिर होने में 5 से 7 साल का समय लगता है लेकिन देश के ईमानदार लोगों का उत्साह, देश की ईमानदारी का उत्सव जन-शक्ति की भागीदारी का नतीज़ा है कि एक साल के भीतर-भीतर बहुतेक मात्रा में ये नई कर प्रणाली अपनी जगह बना चुकी है, स्थिरता प्राप्त कर चुकी है और आवश्यकता के अनुसार अपनी inbuilt व्यवस्था के द्वारा वो सुधार भी करती रहती है। ये अपने आप में एक बहुत बड़ी सफ़लता सवा-सौ करोड़ देशवासियों ने अर्जित की है |\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो! फिर एक बार ‘मन की बात’ को पूर्ण करते हुए अगले ‘मन की बात’ का इंतज़ार कर रहा हूँ, आपसे मिलने का, आपसे बातें करने का। आपको बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएँ |\nबहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद।"

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

MyGov আর NarendraModiApp- দুটি app-এ অনেকে আমাকে লিখেছেন যে ‘মন কি বাত’-এর এই সংখ্যায়, আসন্ন পয়লা জুলাইয়ের ‘Doctor’s Day’ অর্থাৎ ‘ডাক্তার দিবস’ উপলক্ষ্যে আমি আলোচনা করি।\nখুবই সময়োচিত প্রস্তাব! বিপদে-আপদে আমরা ডাক্তারদের শরণাপন্ন হই সারা বছর, কিন্তু পয়লা জুলাই এমন একটা দিনযেদিন আমরা ডাক্তারদের অবদান, ডাক্তারদের অভিজ্ঞতাকে সম্মান করি। সমাজের প্রতি ডাক্তারদের সেবা আর সমর্পণেরজন্যে তাঁদের অকুন্ঠ ধন্যবাদ জানাই। আমরা সেইসব লোক যারা স্বাভাবিক ভাবেই মাকে ভগবানের প্রতিমূর্তি, ঈশ্বরের স্বরূপজেনে পুজো করি — কারণ মা আমাদের জীবন দেয়, জন্ম দেয়। আর ডাক্তাররা তো আমাদের পুনর্জন্ম দেন — একবারনয়, অনেকবারই। একজন ডাক্তারের ভূমিকা শুধুমাত্র রোগ আর অসুস্থতা থেকে আমাদের সুস্থ করা পর্যন্তই সীমিত নয়, অনেক ক্ষেত্রে তাঁরা আমাদের পারিবারিক বন্ধু হয়ে যান। তাঁরা আমাদের জীবনচর্যায় পথপ্রদর্শক: “তাঁরা শুধু সুস্থ করেতোলেন না, আরোগ্যের পথ দেখান”। একজন ডাক্তার এখন শুধু চিকিৎসক হিসেবেই দক্ষ নন, তিনি আধুনিক জীবনধারায়স্বাস্থ্যের ওপর প্রভাব বিষয়ে গভীরভাবে পারদর্শী, অভিজ্ঞ। ভারতীয় ডাক্তাররা আজ নিজেদের দক্ষতা আর কর্মক্ষমতারকারণে সারা বিশ্বে সুবিদিত। চিকিৎসা জগতে আমাদের ডাক্তাররা পরিশ্রমী এবং জটিল স্বাস্থ্য-সমস্যার সমাধান করারব্যাপারে পরিচিতি লাভ করেছেন।\n‘মন কি বাত’-এর মাধ্যমে, সকল দেশবাসীর পক্ষ থেকে আমি আমাদের সব ডাক্তারবন্ধুকে আগামী ১লা জুলাইয়ের ‘ডক্টর্সডে’ উপলক্ষ্যে অনেক শুভকামনা জানাচ্ছি।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, আমরা সেইসব ভাগ্যবান যাদের জন্ম এই ভারতের ভূমিতে হয়েছে। ভারতবর্ষের ইতিহাস এতটাই সমৃদ্ধ, এতটাই ঐশ্বর্যশালী যে এমন একটিও মাস বা দিন নেই যে সময়ে কোনও ঐতিহাসিক ঘটনা ঘটেনি। এই ভারতের প্রতিটিজায়গার, প্রতি প্রান্তের কোনো না কোনো ঐতিহ্য রয়েছে। এই দেশের প্রত্যেকটি অংশ যুক্ত আছে কোনো মহাপুরুষ, কোনো  কিংবদন্তীর সঙ্গে। প্রত্যেকের অবদানই মহৎ।\n“মাননীয় প্রধানমন্ত্রী, নমস্কার। আমি Dr. সুরেন্দ্র মিশ্র বলছি। আমরা জানতে পেরেছি যে আঠাশে জুন আপনি মগহরআসছেন। আমি মগহর-এর কাছেই, গোরখপুরের একটা ছোট গ্রাম Tadwa-তে থাকি। মগহর-এ সন্ত কবীর-এর পুণ্যসমাধিস্থল। সাম্য আর ঐক্যের বাণীর জন্যে সন্ত কবীরকে মানুষ এখনো মনে রেখেছে। সমাজের সর্বস্তরে ওঁর ভাবাদর্শকে নিয়েআলোচনা হয়। আপনার কর্ম-অভিযানের ফলে এই দিশায় গভীর প্রভাব পড়বে বলে আমার বিশ্বাস। আমার সনির্বন্ধ অনুরোধ, এই বিষয়ে ভারত সরকারের নানান কর্ম-পরিকল্পনা বিষয়ে আমাদের অবহিত করুন।”\nআপনার ফোনের জন্যে ধন্যবাদ। হ্যাঁ, আমি ২৮ তারিখে মগহর যাব। আমি যখন গুজরাটে ছিলাম, আপনি নিশ্চয়ইগুজরাটের Kabirwad জায়গাটি ভালোভাবে জানেন, সেই সময়ে আমি ওখানে সন্ত কবীরের পরম্পরায় যুক্ত যাঁরা, তাঁদেরজন্যে এক বিরাট জাতীয় অধিবেশনের আয়োজন করেছিলাম। আপনারা কি জানেন, কবীরদাসজী কেন এই মগহর-এ  গিয়েছিলেন? সেই সময়ে একটি প্রচলিত ধারণা ছিল যে যার মগহর-এ মৃত্যু হয়, তিনি স্বর্গে প্রবেশ করতে পারেন না। বরঞ্চযাঁরা কাশিতে দেহত্যাগ করেন তাঁরাই স্বর্গে যান। মগহর-কে অপবিত্র মনে করা হতো। কিন্তু সন্ত কবীরের এই ধারণায় কোনোবিশ্বাস ছিল না। নিজের সমকালের এই অন্ধবিশ্বাস আর কুসংস্কারকে ভাঙবার জন্যেই সন্ত কবীর মগহরে সমাধিস্থ হন। নিজেরকবিতা, সাখি আর দোঁহার মাধ্যমে সন্ত কবীর সামাজিক সাম্য, শান্তি আর ভ্রাতৃত্বের কথাই বলেছেন বারে বারে। যা ছিলওঁর জীবনের আদর্শ। কবীরের রচনাতে সেই আদর্শই আমরা দেখতে পাই আর আজকের যুগেও সেই বাণী সমান ভাবে প্রেরণাযোগায়। ওঁর একটি দোঁহা থেকে বলি :\n“কবীর সোঈ পীর হ্যায়, জো জানে পর পীর।\nজো পর পীর ন জান হি, সো কা পীর মে পীর।।”\nঅর্থাৎ প্রকৃত সাধক তিনিই, যিনি অন্যদের দুঃখ জানতে পারেন, বুঝতে পারেন। যিনি অন্যের দুঃখ-কষ্টকে বোঝেন না, তিনি নিষ্ঠুর। কবীরদাসজী সামাজিক সমন্বয়ে বিশেষ জোর দিয়েছিলেন। তিনি তাঁর সময়ের থেকে এগিয়ে ভাবতেন। যে কালে সমগ্র বিশ্বে মানবিকতার অবনতি ও সংঘর্ষের পরম্পরা চলছে, সেই সময়ে তিনি শান্তি ও সম্প্রীতির বাণী প্রচার করেন এবং মানবজাতিকে একত্রিত করে, মতানৈক্য দূর করার কাজ করেছিলেন।\n“জগমে বৈরি কোঈ নেহি, জো মন শীতল হোয়।\nইহ আপা তো ডাল দে, দয়া করে সব কোয়।।”\nআরেক দোঁহায় কবীরদাসজী বলছেন,\n“যাঁহা দয়া তহঁ ধর্ম হ্যায়, যাহাঁ লোভ তহঁ পাপ।\nযাহাঁ ক্রোধ তহঁ কাল হ্যায়, যাহাঁ ক্ষমা তহঁ আপ।।”\nতিনি বলেছেন, ‘জাতি না পুছো সাধু কী, পুছ লিজিয়ে জ্ঞান’।\nসকল মানুষের কাছে তিনি আবেদন রেখেছেন যে তাঁরা যেন কোনও মানুষকে ধর্ম বা জাত-পাতের নিরিখে বিচার না করে তাকে তাঁর জ্ঞানের নিরিখে মান্যতা দেন এবং তাঁকে সম্মান করেন। তাঁর এই অমূল্য বাণী আজ এতদিন পরেও একইভাবে প্রভাব বিস্তার করে, এখন যখন আমরা সন্ত কবি কবীরদাসজী সম্পর্কে কথা বলছি, তখন ওঁর এক দোঁহার কথা মনে পড়ছে। যেখানে কবীরদাসজী বলেছেন,\n“গুরু গোবিন্দ দোঔ খড়ে, কাকে লাগু পায়।\nবলিহারি গুরু আপনে, গোবিন্দ দিয়ো বতায়ে।।”\nএটাই হচ্ছে গুরুর মহানতা এবং এরকমই একজন গুরু হচ্ছেন জগৎগুরু — গুরু নানক দেব। যিনি কোটি কোটি মানুষকে সত্যের পথ দেখিয়েছেন, যা আবহমান কাল ধরে মানুষকে প্রেরণা দিয়ে আসছে। গুরু নানকদেবজী সমাজে জাতিগত ভেদাভেদকে নির্মূল করতে চেয়েছেন এবং সব মানুষকে একই মানবজাতির সদস্য হিসেবে মেনে নিয়ে একে অপরের সঙ্গে কাঁধে কাঁধ মিলিয়ে চলার শিক্ষা দিয়েছেন। তিনি বলতেন গরীব ও অভাবী মানুষের সেবাই ভগবানের সেবা। তিনি যেখানেই গেছেন, সমাজের ভালো করার লক্ষ্যে অনেক উদ্যোগ নিয়েছেন। সামাজিক ভেদাভেদ ভুলে খাওয়াদাওয়ার ব্যবস্থা করেছেন যেখানে জাতি-ধর্ম-সম্প্রদায় নির্বিশেষে স্বচ্ছন্দে খাবার খেতে পারেন। গুরু নানকজীই পংক্তিভোজন ব্যবস্থার শুরু করেছিলেন। ২০১৯-এ গুরু নানকদেবজীর ৫৫০-তম প্রকাশ পর্ব উদ্‌যাপিত হবে। আমার আবেদন, আসুন, আমরা সবাই মিলে উৎসাহ এবং আনন্দের সঙ্গে এই অনুষ্ঠানে সামিল হই। আপনাদের সকলের কাছ থেকে আমি আশা করছি, গুরু নানকদেবজীর ৫৫০-তম প্রকাশ পর্ব পুরো দেশে এবং সমগ্র বিশ্বে কীভাবে উদ্‌যাপিত হবে, নতুন নতুন পরিকল্পনা কী হবে, নতুন সংকল্পগুলি কী হবে, এইসব বিষয়ে আমরা চিন্তা-ভাবনা করি, প্রস্তুতি নিই এবং গর্বের সঙ্গে আমরা এই প্রকাশ পর্বকে প্রেরণা পর্ব হিসাবে পালন করি।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, ভারতের স্বাধীনতা আন্দোলন অনেক দীর্ঘ, অনেক বড়, খুব গভীর। অসংখ্য শহীদের ইতিহাস। পাঞ্জাবের সঙ্গে সংশ্লিষ্ট হয়ে আছে এমনই আর একটি ইতিহাস। ২০১৯-এ জালিয়ানওয়ালাবাগের সেই ভয়াবহ ঘটনা, যার ১০০ বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। সেই ঘটনা, যা মানবতাকে লজ্জিত করেছিল। ১৯১৯ সালের ১৩ এপ্রিল সেই কালোদিনকে কেউ ভুলতে পেরেছে, যখন শক্তির অপব্যবহার করে নিষ্ঠুরতার সমস্ত সীমা পার করে নির্দোষ, নিরস্ত্র এবং নিরীহ সাধারণ মানুষের উপর গুলি বর্ষিত হয়েছিল। এই মর্মান্তিক ঘটনার ১০০ বছর পূর্তি হতে চলেছে। কিন্তু এই ঘটনা যে শাশ্বত বার্তা দিয়েছে, তা আমরা সবসময় মনে রাখব, সেটি হল, হিংসা ও হানাহানির মধ্যে দিয়ে কখনও কোনও সমস্যার সমাধান করা যায় না। শান্তি, অহিংসা, ত্যাগ ও বলিদানেরই সর্বদা জয় হয়।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, দিল্লির রোহিনীর শ্রী রমণ কুমার ‘নরেন্দ্রমোদি মোবাইল অ্যাপ’-এ লিখেছেন আগামী ৬-ই জুলাই ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির জন্মদিন এবং তিনি চান ‘মন কি বাত’-এর এবারের পর্বে ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির সম্বন্ধে আমি দেশবাসীর সঙ্গে কথা বলি।\nরমণজী, সবার প্রথমে আপনাকে অনেক অনেক ধন্যবাদ! ভারতের ইতিহাসের প্রতি আপনার আগ্রহ দেখে খুব ভালো লাগল। আপনি জানেন, গতকাল ২৩শে জুনই ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির প্রয়াণ দিবস ছিল। ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জি বহু বিষয়ের সঙ্গে যুক্ত ছিলেন। কিন্তু তাঁর সবচেয়ে প্রিয় বিষয়গুলি ছিল — Education, Administration এবং Parliamentary Affairs। খুব কম মানুষই হয়তো জানেন উনি কলকাতা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের সর্বকনিষ্ঠ ভাইস-চ্যান্সেলর ছিলেন। মাত্র ৩৩ বছর বয়সে উনি ভাইস-চ্যান্সেলর হয়েছিলেন। এটাও হয়তো খুব কম মানুষ জানেন, ১৯৩৭ সালে ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির আমন্ত্রণেই গুরুদেব রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর কলকাতা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের কনভোকেশনে বাংলা ভাষায় বক্তব্য রেখেছিলেন। সেটিই প্রথম উদাহরণ ছিল যখন ইংরেজ শাসনকালে কোনও ব্যক্তি কলকাতা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের কনভোকেশনে বাংলা ভাষায় বক্তব্য রাখেন। ১৯৪৭ থেকে ১৯৫০ পর্যন্ত ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জি ভারতের প্রথম শিল্পমন্ত্রী ছিলেন এবং এক অর্থে বলতে গেলে ভারতের শিল্পোন্নতি এবং সার্বিক ভাবে ভারতের প্রগতির মজবুত ভিত্তি প্রস্তর স্থাপন করেছিলেন, তাকে এক শক্তিশালী ভিত্তি এবং মঞ্চে দাঁড় করিয়েছিলেন। ১৯৪৮-এ স্বাধীন ভারতের প্রথম শিল্পনীতি, ওঁর পরিকল্পনা ও দূরদৃষ্টির ওপর নির্ভর করেই তৈরি হয়েছিল। ড. মুখার্জির স্বপ্ন ছিল, শিল্পের প্রতিটি ক্ষেত্রে ভারত আত্মনির্ভর, উন্নত ও সমৃদ্ধ হবে। তিনি চাইতেন, ভারত বৃহৎ শিল্প গড়ে তুলুক এবং তার সঙ্গে MSMEs, তাঁতশিল্প, বস্ত্র ও কুটিরশিল্পের প্রতিও পুরোপুরি মনোযোগ দিক। কুটিরশিল্প ও লঘুশিল্পের যথাযথ বিকাশের জন্য উনি ফাইন্যান্স এবং অরগানাইজেশন সেট আপ পেয়েছিলেন।\nযেকারণে ১৯৪৮ থেকে ১৯৫০-এর মধ্যে All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board এবং Khadi & Village Industries Board স্থাপন করা হয়েছিল। ভারতের প্রতিরক্ষা উৎপাদনের স্বদেশীকরণের উপরও ড. মুখার্জি বিশেষ গুরুত্ব আরোপ করেছিলেন। চিত্তরঞ্জন লোকোমোটিভ ওয়ার্কস ফ্যাক্টরি, হিন্দুস্থান এয়ারক্র্যাফট ফ্যাক্টরি, সিন্ধ্রির সার কারখানা এবং দামোদর ভ্যালি করপোরেশান — এই চারটি সবচেয়ে বড় ও সফল প্রজেক্ট এবং অন্যান্য River Valley Project স্থাপনে ড. শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির বিরাট অবদান ছিল। পশ্চিমবঙ্গের উন্নতির বিষয়ে উনি খুব আবেগপ্রবণ ছিলেন। ওঁর চিন্তাভাবনা, বিবেকবোধ ও সক্রিয়তার ফলেই পশ্চিমবঙ্গের একটি অংশ রক্ষা করা গেছে এবং সেটি আজও ভারতবর্ষের অংশরূপে রয়েছে। ডক্টর শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির কাছে সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় ছিল ভারতের একতা এবং অখণ্ডতা। আর এই কারণেই মাত্র ৫২ বছর বয়সে তাঁকে প্রাণ বিসর্জন দিতে হয়। আসুন, আমরা ডক্টর শ্যামাপ্রসাদ মুখার্জির এই একতার বার্তাকে মনে রাখি এবং সৌহার্দ্য ও ভ্রাতৃত্বের মধ্য দিয়ে ভারতকে এগিয়ে নিয়ে যাওয়ার পথে আন্তরিক প্রচেষ্টা চালিয়ে যাই।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, বিগত কয়েক সপ্তাহ ধরে আমার সুযোগ হয়েছিল ভিডিও কলের মাধ্যমে সরকারের বিভিন্ন যোজনা থেকে যাঁরা উপকৃত হয়েছেন, সেই সব ব্যক্তিদের সঙ্গে কথা বলবার। ফাইল থেকে সরে এসে সরাসরি মানুষের মুখ থেকে শোনার সুযোগ পেয়েছিলাম তাঁদের জীবনে আসা পরিবর্তনের কথা। মানুষজন জানিয়েছেন নিজেদের সংকল্প, সুখ-দুঃখের কথা, উপলব্ধির কথা। আমি মনে করি, এটা আমার কাছে শুধু এক সরকারী অনুষ্ঠানই ছিল না, বরং এ ছিল অন্য ধরনের learning experience। আর এই সময়ে জনসাধারণের চোখেমুখে যে আনন্দ আমি প্রত্যক্ষ করেছি তার থেকে বেশি সন্তুষ্টি আর কিসে হতে পারে? যখন একজন সাধারণ মানুষের কথা শুনতাম, তাঁর সহজ সরল শব্দ, বাচনভঙ্গী, নিজস্ব অনুভবের কথা, তখন তা হৃদয়কে স্পর্শ করে যেত। জেনেছিলাম, সুদূর প্রত্যন্ত গ্রামে মেয়েরা common service centre থেকে কীভাবে গ্রামের বয়স্ক, বৃদ্ধদের পেনসন থেকে শুরু করে সাধারণ মানুষের পাসপোর্ট তৈরিতে সাহায্য করে চলেছে।\nছত্তিশগড়ের এক বোন আতা সংগ্রহ করে তার থেকে আইসক্রিম তৈরির ব্যবসা করছেন, ঝাড়খণ্ডে অঞ্জন প্রকাশের মত দেশের লক্ষ লক্ষ তরুণ ‘জন-ঔষধি’ ব্যবস্থা চালানোর সঙ্গে সঙ্গে আশেপাশের গ্রামগুলিতে গিয়ে গিয়ে সুলভে ওষুধপত্র সরবরাহ করছেন। পশ্চিমবঙ্গে যে যুবকটি দু-তিন বছর আগেও চাকরি খুঁজে বেড়াচ্ছিলেন, এখন তিনি সাফল্যের সঙ্গে নিজের ব্যবসাই শুধু চালাচ্ছেন না, ১০-১৫ জন মানুষকে চাকরি দিয়ে তাদের অন্নসংস্থান করেছেন। এদিকে তামিলনাড়ু, পাঞ্জাব, গোয়াতে স্কুলের ছাত্ররা এই অল্প বয়সেই স্কুলের ‘টিংকারিং ল্যাব’-এ ওয়েস্ট ম্যানেজমেন্টের মত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয়ের ওপর কাজ করছে। এই রকম অসংখ্য অনুভবের গল্প ছিল সেখানে। দেশের এমন কোনও প্রান্ত ছিল না যেখান থেকে সাফল্যের বার্তা আসেনি। আমি এই ভেবে আনন্দিত যে, সমগ্র অনুষ্ঠানটিতে সরকারের সাফল্যের থেকে সাধারণ মানুষের সাফল্যের শক্তি, দেশের-দশের শক্তি, ‘নতুন ভারত’ স্বপ্নের শক্তি, সংকল্পের শক্তি আমি অনুভব করেছি। সমাজে কিছু মানুষ থাকেন, যতক্ষণ তাঁরা নিরাশাব্যঞ্জক কথাবার্তা না বলেন, হতাশার কথা না বলেন, অবিশ্বাস তৈরির কাজ না করেন, গড়ার বদলে ভাঙার রাস্তা না খোঁজেন, ততক্ষণ তাঁরা শান্তি পান না। এই রকম বাতাবরণে সাধারণ মানুষজন যখন নতুন আশা, নতুন উৎসাহ নিয়ে নিজের জীবনের উপলব্ধির কথা বলেন, তখন তার সাফল্য সরকারের নয় তাঁদেরই প্রাপ্য। সুদূর প্রান্তের এক ক্ষুদ্র গ্রামের এক ছোট্ট মেয়ের কাহিনিও ১২৫ কোটি মানুষের জন্য প্রেরণা সঞ্চার করে। টেকনোলজির সাহায্যে, ভিডিও ব্রিজের মাধ্যমে সরকারী যোজনা থেকে উপকৃত ব্যক্তিদের সঙ্গে সময় কাটানোর মুহূর্তগুলি আমার কাছে ছিল অত্যন্ত মধুর ও খুবই প্রেরণাদায়ক। আর এতে কাজ করার সন্তুষ্টি তো পাওয়া যায়ই, আরও বেশি কাজ করার উৎসাহ বৃদ্ধি পায়। দরিদ্র থেকে দরিদ্রতম ব্যক্তির কাছ থেকেও জীবনযাপনের নতুন উৎসাহ, নতুন প্রেরণা পাওয়া যায়। আমি দেশবাসীর কাছে কৃতজ্ঞ। আপনারা ৪০-৪০, ৫০-৫০ লাখ লোক এই ভিডিও ব্রিজ অনুষ্ঠানের সঙ্গে যুক্ত হয়েছেন আর আমাকে নতুন শক্তি প্রদান করেছেন। আমি আরও একবার আপনাদের প্রতি কৃতজ্ঞতা ব্যক্ত করছি।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, আমি সবসময় মনে করি, আশে পাশে তাকালে দেখা যাবে কোথাও না কোথাও, কিছু না কিছু ভাল কাজ হয়ে চলেছে, ভাল করার লোকজনেরা রয়েছেন। ভালোর এই ‘সুগন্ধ’, তা আমারও অনুভূত হয়েছে। কিছুদিন আগে যে ব্যাপারটি আমার দৃষ্টিগোচর হয়েছে, তা হল এক অদ্ভূত সুন্দর combination, এতে একদিকে যেমন প্রফেশনাল আর ইঞ্জিনিয়াররা আছেন, তেমনই অন্যদিকে আছেন মাঠে কাজ করা কৃষক ভাই-বোনেরা। আপনাদের মনে হতেই পারে এতো সম্পূর্ণ পৃথক পেশা, এর আবার সম্বন্ধ কি করে হয়? আসলে ব্যাপারটা হল এই যে, বেঙ্গালুরুর করপোরেট প্রফেশনালরা, আই-টি ইঞ্জিনিয়াররা একসঙ্গে মিলে একটি ‘সহজ সমৃদ্ধি ট্রাস্ট’ তৈরি করেছেন আর কৃষকদের আয় দ্বিগুণ করার লক্ষ্যে এই ট্রাস্টকে অ্যাকটিভেট করেছেন, অর্থাৎ কাজে লাগিয়েছেন। এই ট্রাস্টের মাধ্যমে এঁরা কৃষকদের সঙ্গে যুক্ত হয়েছেন, যোজনা নির্মাণ করেছেন এবং কৃষকদের আয় কীভাবে বৃদ্ধি করা যায়, তার সার্থক প্রচেষ্টা চালিয়ে যাচ্ছেন। চাষের নতুন নতুন পদ্ধতির সঙ্গে জৈবিক চাষ কীভাবে করা যায় এবং এক ফসলের সঙ্গে সঙ্গে অন্য ফসলও কীভাবে ফলানো যায় — এই সমস্ত ট্রেনিং এই ট্রাস্টের মাধ্যমে এই প্রফেশনাল, ইঞ্জিনিয়ার ও প্রযুক্তিবিদদের সহযোগিতা কৃষকভাইদের দেওয়া হচ্ছে। আগে যে সমস্ত কৃষক শুধু একটি মাত্র ফসলের ওপর নির্ভরশীল ছিল, যাতে ফসলও ভাল হত না আর লাভও তেমন হত না, আজ তারা শুধুমাত্র একাধিক ফসলই ফলাচ্ছেন না, এই ট্রাস্টের মাধ্যমে ফসলের সঠিক বিপণন করে ভালো মুনাফা লাভ করছেন। আনাজ উৎপাদনকারী কৃষকেরা এই ব্যবস্থার সঙ্গে যুক্ত হয়েছেন। এই ব্যবস্থায় একদিকে যেমন ফসল ফলানো থেকে বিপণন — এই গোটা শৃঙ্খলে কৃষকদের মুখ্য ভূমিকা রয়েছে, অন্যদিকে কৃষকদের অংশীদারীত্ব এবং লাভের মাত্রাও সুনিশ্চিত করার প্রচেষ্টা রয়েছে। ফসল ভালো তখনই হবে যখন ভালো প্রজাতির বীজের ব্যবহার হবে। এর জন্য আলাদা করে Seed Bank বানানো হয়েছে। মহিলারা এই Seed Bank দেখাশোনার কাজ করেন। এইভাবে মহিলাদেরও এর সঙ্গে যুক্ত করা হয়েছে। আমি এই সমস্ত যুবকদের এই অভিনব প্রচেষ্টার জন্য অনেক অনেক শুভেচ্ছা জানাচ্ছি, আর এটা দেখে আনন্দ লাভ করছি যে প্রফেশনাল, টেকনোক্র্যাট — যাঁরা ইঞ্জিনিয়ারিং জগতের সঙ্গে যুক্ত, তাঁরা নিজ নিজ গণ্ডি থেকে বেরিয়ে এসে কৃষকদের সঙ্গে, গ্রামের সঙ্গে, ক্ষেত-খামারের সঙ্গে, মাটির সঙ্গে যুক্ত হওয়ার রাস্তা বেছে নিয়েছেন। আমি আরও একবার দেশের যুবশক্তিকে ও তাদের এই ধরনের অভিনব প্রচেষ্টাকে, যার কিছুটা হয়ত আমি জানি, কিছুটা জানি না, যার কিছুটা হয়ত লোকে জানে, কিছুটা লোকে জানে না, কিন্তু এই যে নিরন্তর কোটি কোটি মানুষ কিছু না কিছু ভালো কাজ করে চলেছেন, তাঁদের সবাইকে অনেক অনেক শুভেচ্ছা!\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, জি-এস-টি ব্যবস্থার ১ বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। ‘One Nation One Tax’ যা দেশবাসীর স্বপ্ন ছিল, তা আজ বাস্তবায়িত হয়েছে। ‘One Nation One Tax reform’ — এই ব্যবস্থার জন্য যদি আমাকে কাউকে credit দিতে হয়, তবে আমি রাজ্যগুলিকে এই credit দেবো। জি-এস-টি ‘কো-অপারেটিভ ফেডারিলিজম’-এর এক সুন্দর উদাহরণ, যেখানে সমস্ত রাজ্যগুলি একসঙ্গে দেশের কল্যাণের কথা মাথায় রেখে সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছিল আর তারই ফলস্বরূপ দেশে এত বড় ট্যাক্স রিফর্ম ব্যবস্থা চালু করা গেছে। এখনও পর্যন্ত জি-এস-টি কাউন্সিলের ২৭-টি মিটিং হয়েছে ও আমরা গর্ব করতে পারি যে ভিন্ন ভিন্ন রাজনৈতিক চিন্তাধারার ব্যক্তিরা, আলাদা আলাদা রাজ্য এমনকি পৃথক পৃথক priority-যুক্ত রাজ্যের প্রতিনিধিরা সেখানে থাকা সত্ত্বেও জি-এস-টি কাউন্সিল-এ আজ পর্যন্ত যত সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া গেছে, তা সর্বসম্মতিতে নেওয়া হয়েছে। জি-এস-টি’র আগে দেশে ১৭ ধরনের আলাদা আলাদা ট্যাক্স ছিল। কিন্তু এই ব্যবস্থা চালু হওয়ার পর এখন সারা দেশে একটাই কর প্রণালী। জি-এস-টি সততার জিত আর সততা এক উৎসবও বটে। আগে প্রায়শই করপ্রণালী নিয়ে দেশে ‘ইনস্পেকটর রাজ’ চলছে — এই ধরনের অভিযোগ শোনা যেত। জি-এস-টি আসার পর ইনস্পেকটরের স্থান আই-টি অর্থাৎ ইনফরমেশন টেকনোলজি নিয়ে নিয়েছে। ‘রিটার্ন’ থেকে ‘রিফাণ্ড’ পর্যন্ত পুরোটাই বর্তমানে অনলাইনে ‘ইনফরমেশন টেকনোলজি’র মাধ্যমে কার্যকরী হচ্ছে। জি-এস-টি আসার পর চেক পোস্টগুলিও বন্ধ হয়েছে আর এর ফলে পণ্য ও অন্যান্য জিনিসপত্রের পরিবহনে গতি বৃদ্ধি পেয়েছে। এতে শুধুমাত্র সময়ই বাঁচেনি, সঙ্গে সঙ্গে লজিস্টিক ক্ষেত্রগুলিতেও লাভ হতে দেখা যাচ্ছে। জি-এস-টি সম্ভবত বিশ্বের সর্ববৃহৎ Tax reform ব্যবস্থা। ভারতে এত বড় Tax Reform সফল হয়েছে কারণ দেশের জনসাধারণ এই ব্যবস্থাকে গ্রহণ করেছেন, আর এই জনশক্তি, জনগ্রাহ্যতাই জি-এস-টি’র সাফল্য সুনিশ্চিত করেছে। সাধারণভাবে মনে করা হয়, এত বড় আকারের reform এত বিপুল জনসংখ্যা সম্পন্ন এত বড় দেশে সঠিকভাবে রূপায়িত হতে ৫ থেকে ৭ বছরের সময় লাগে। কিন্তু সত্যনিষ্ঠ দেশবাসীর উৎসাহ, দেশের সততার উৎসবের প্রবাহ ও জনশক্তির অংশীদারিত্বের পরিণাম হল এই যে, এক বছরের মধ্যেই এই নতুন কর প্রণালী নিজের জায়গা তৈরি করে নিয়েছে, স্থিতি পেয়েছে ও দরকার মতো inbuilt ব্যবস্থার মাধ্যমে নিজেকে সংশোধনও করে চলেছে। এ এক খুব বড় সাফল্য, যা দেশের ১২৫ কোটি দেশবাসী অর্জন করেছে।\nআমার প্রিয় দেশবাসী, আরও একবার ‘মন কি বাত’ শেষ করতে করতে অপেক্ষা করছি পরবর্তী ‘মন কি বাত’-এর। অপেক্ষা রইল আপনাদের সঙ্গে দেখা করার, কথা বলার। আপনাদের অনেক অনেক শুভেচ্ছা, অনেক অনেক ধন্যবাদ!\n"

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.

Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me.

An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.

But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July.

I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.

ଏବଂ ସଂସଦୀୟ ବ୍ୟାପାର କ୍ଷେତ୍ରଗୁଡ଼ିକ ସହ ସେ ବିଶେଷ ଭାବରେ ସମ୍ପୃକ୍ତ ଥିଲେ । ଏହା ବହୁତ କମ୍ ଲୋକ ଜାଣିଥିବେ ଯେ ସେ କୋଲକାତା ବିଶ୍ୱବିଦ୍ୟାଳୟର ସବୁଠାରୁ କମ୍ ବୟସର କୁଳପତି ଥିଲେ । ସେ ଯେତେବେଳେ କୁଳପତି ହୋଇଥିଲେ ସେତେବେଳେ ତାଙ୍କର ବୟସ ଥିଲା ମାତ୍ର 33 । ଏହାମଧ୍ୟ ବହୁତ କମ୍ ଲୋକ ଜାଣିଥିବେ ଯେ 1937 ମସିହାରେ ଡ. ଶ୍ୟାମାପ୍ରସାଦ ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀଙ୍କ ନିମନ୍ତ୍ରଣରେ ଶ୍ରୀ ଗୁରୁଦେବ ରବୀନ୍ଦ୍ରନାଥ ଠାକୁର କୋଲକାତା ବିଶ୍ୱବିଦ୍ୟାଳୟରେ ଅନୁଷ୍ଠିତ ସମାବର୍ତ୍ତନ ସମାରୋହକୁ ବଙ୍ଗଳା ଭାଷାରେ ସମ୍ବୋଧିତ କରିଥିଲେ । ଏହା ପ୍ରଥମ ଘଟଣା ଥିଲା ଯେତେବେଳେ ଇଂରେଜମାନଙ୍କର ସାମ୍ରାଜ୍ୟ ଥିଲା ଏବଂ କୋଲକାତା ବିଶ୍ୱବିଦ୍ୟାଳୟରେ କୌଣସି ବ୍ୟକ୍ତି ବଙ୍ଗଳା ଭାଷାରେ ସମାବର୍ତ୍ତନ ଉତ୍ସବକୁ ସମ୍ବୋଧିତ କରିଥିଲେ । 1947ରୁ 1950 ପର୍ଯ୍ୟନ୍ତ ଡ. ଶ୍ୟାମାପ୍ରସାଦ ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀ ଭାରତର ସର୍ବପ୍ରଥମ ଶିଳ୍ପମନ୍ତ୍ରୀ ଥିଲେ ଏବଂ ଗୋଟିଏ ଦୃଷ୍ଟିରୁ କହିବାକୁ ଗଲେ ସେ ଭାରତର ଶିଳ୍ପବିକାଶର ଶିଳାନ୍ୟାସ କରିଥିଲେ । ସୁଦୃଢ଼ ଆଧାର ପ୍ରସ୍ତୁତ କରିଥିଲେ ଏବଂ ଏକ ଦୃଢ଼ ଭିତ୍ତି ବା ମଞ୍ଚ ନିର୍ମାଣ କରିଥିଲେ । 1948 ରେ  ସ୍ୱାଧୀନ ଭାରତର ପ୍ରଥମ ଶିଳ୍ପନୀତି ତାଙ୍କରି ବିଚାର ଓ ଦୂରଦୃଷ୍ଟିର ପ୍ରଭାବ ନେଇ ଆସିଥିଲା । ଡ. ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀଙ୍କର ସ୍ୱପ୍ନ ଥିଲା ଯେ ଭାରତ ପ୍ରତିଟି କ୍ଷେତ୍ରରେ ଶିଳ୍ପ ଦୃଷ୍ଟିରୁ ଆତ୍ମନିର୍ଭର ହେଉ, କୁଶଳ ଏବଂ ସମୃଦ୍ଧ ହେଉ । ସେ ଚାହୁଁଥିଲେ ଯେ ଭାରତ ବୃହତ ଶିଳ୍ପଗୁଡ଼ିକର ବିକାଶ କରୁ । ଏଥିସହିତ ଏମ୍ଏସ୍ଏମ୍ଇ, ହସ୍ତତନ୍ତ, ବସ୍ତ୍ର ଓ କୁଟୀରଶିଳ୍ପ ଉପରେ ମଧ୍ୟ ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ ଧ୍ୟାନକେନ୍ଦ୍ରିତ କରୁ । କୁଟୀର ଓ ଲଘୁଶିଳ୍ପର ସମୁଚିତ ବିକାଶ ପାଇଁ ସେମାନଙ୍କୁ ଅର୍ଥ ଓ ଆନୁଷ୍ଠାନିକ ବ୍ୟବସ୍ଥା ମିଳୁ, ଏଥିପାଇଁ 1948ରୁ 1950 ମଧ୍ୟରେ ସର୍ବଭାରତୀୟ ହସ୍ତଶିଳ୍ପ ବୋର୍ଡ, ସର୍ବଭାରତୀୟ ହସ୍ତତନ୍ତ ବୋର୍ଡ ଏବଂ ଖଦି ଓ ଗ୍ରାମୋଦ୍ୟୋଗ ବୋର୍ଡ ପ୍ରତିଷ୍ଠା କରାଯାଇଥିଲା । ଡ. ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀଙ୍କର ଭାରତର ସୁରକ୍ଷା ଉପକରଣ ଉତ୍ପାଦନର ସ୍ୱଦେଶୀକରଣ ଉପରେ ମଧ୍ୟ ବିଶେଷ ଗୁରୁତ୍ୱ ଦେଉଥିଲେ । ଚିତ୍ତରଞ୍ଜନ ରେଳ ମରାମତି କାରଖାନା, ହିନ୍ଦୁସ୍ଥାନ ବିମାନ କାରଖାନା, ସିନ୍ଦ୍ରିର ସାର କାରଖାନା ଏବଂ ଦାମୋଦର ଘାଟି ନିଗମ – ଏହି ଚାରିଗୋଟି ସବୁଠୁ ସଫଳ ଏବଂ ବଡ଼ ପ୍ରକଳ୍ପ ତଥା ଅନ୍ୟ ନଦୀ ଉପତ୍ୟକା ଯୋଜନାଗୁଡ଼ିକର ପ୍ରତିଷ୍ଠାରେ ଡ. ଶ୍ୟାମାପ୍ରସାଦ ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀଙ୍କର ବହୁତ ବଡ଼ ଯୋଗଦାନ ଥିଲା । ପଶ୍ଚିମବଙ୍ଗର ଉନ୍ନତିକୁ ନେଇ ସେ ବହୁତ ଉତ୍ସାହିତ ଥିଲେ । ତାଙ୍କରି ବୁଦ୍ଧି, ବିଚାରଶକ୍ତି ଓ କାର୍ଯ୍ୟକୁଶଳତାର ଏହା ପରିଣାମ ଯେ ବଙ୍ଗଳାର ଗୋଟିଏ ଅଂଶକୁ ରକ୍ଷା କରାଯାଇପାରିଲା ଏବଂ ତାହା ଆଜି ଭାରତର ଅଂଶବିଶେଷ ହୋଇରହିଛି । ଡ. ଶ୍ୟାମାପ୍ରସାଦ ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀଙ୍କ ପାଇଁ ଯାହା ସବୁଠୁ ଗୁରୁତ୍ୱପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ ଥିଲା – ତାହା ଥିଲା ଭାରତର ଏକତା ଓ ଅଖଣ୍ଡତା ଏବଂ ଏଇଥିପାଇଁ 52 ବର୍ଷର ସ୍ୱଳ୍ପାୟୁରେ ତାଙ୍କୁ ନିଜର ଜୀବନକୁ ଉତ୍ସର୍ଗ କରିବାକୁ ପଡ଼ିଥିଲା । ଆସନ୍ତୁ! ଆମେମାନେ ସର୍ବଦା ଡ. ଶ୍ୟାମାପ୍ରସାଦ ମୁଖାର୍ଜୀଙ୍କର ଏକତା ସନ୍ଦେଶକୁ ମନେ ରଖିବା ତଥା ସଦ୍ଭାବ ଏବଂ ଭ୍ରାତୃତ୍ୱ ସହିତ ଭାରତର ପ୍ରଗତି ନିମନ୍ତେ ନିଜକୁ ସମର୍ପିତ କରିଦେବା ।\nମୋର ପ୍ରିୟ ଦେଶବାସୀଗଣ, ଗତ କେତେ ସପ୍ତାହ ମଧ୍ୟରେ ମୁଁ ସରକାରଙ୍କ ବିଭିନ୍ନ ଯୋଜନାଗୁଡ଼ିକର ହିତାଧିକାରୀମାନଙ୍କ ସହିତ ଭିଡ଼ିଓ କଲ ମାଧ୍ୟମରେ କଥା ହେବାର ସୁଯୋଗ ପାଇଥିଲି । ଫାଇଲରେ ଥିବା ତଥ୍ୟ ବ୍ୟତିରେକ ଲୋକମାନଙ୍କ ଫାଇଲରେ ସିଧାସଳଖ କ’ଣ ପରିବର୍ତ୍ତନ ଆସିଛି, ତାହା ଜାଣିବାର ସୁଯୋଗ ମିଳିଲା । ଲୋକମାନେ ନିଜର ସଂକଳ୍ପ, ନିଜର ସୁଖଦୁଃଖ ଆଉ ଉପଲବ୍ଧିଗୁଡ଼ିକ ବିଷୟରେ କହିଲେ । ମୋ’ପାଇଁ ଏହା ଏକ ସରକାରୀ କାର୍ଯ୍ୟକ୍ରମ ମାତ୍ର ନ ଥିଲା ବରଂ ଏକ ଶିକ୍ଷାର ଅନୁଭବ ଥିଲା । ଏହା ମାଧ୍ୟମରେ ଲୋକମାନଙ୍କ ମଧ୍ୟରେ ଯେଉଁ ଖୁସିର ଝଲକ ଦେଖିବାକୁ ମିଳିଲା ତା’ଠାରୁ ବଳି ସନ୍ତୋଷ ଆଉ ଜୀବନରେ କ’ଣ ହୋଇପାରେ? ଯେତେବେଳେ ଜଣେ ସାଧାରଣ ମଣିଷର କଥା ଶୁଣୁଥିଲି, ଅତି ନିଷ୍କପଟ ଭାବରେ, ଅତି ସରଳ ଭାଷାରେ ନିଜ ନିଜର ଅନୁଭୂତି ଯେତେବେଳେ ସେମାନେ କହୁଥିଲେ, ସେଗୁଡ଼ିକ ମୋର ହୃଦୟକୁ ଛୁଇଁଯାଉଥିଲା । ଦୂରଦୂରାନ୍ତର ଗାଁଗୁଡ଼ିକରେ ଝିଅମାନେ ସାଧାରଣ ଜନସେବା କେନ୍ଦ୍ରମାଧ୍ୟମରେ ଗାଁର ବୟସ୍କମାନଙ୍କୁ ପେନସନଠାରୁ ଆରମ୍ଭ କରି ପାସପୋର୍ଟବନେଇବା ଯାଏ ବିଭିନ୍ନ ସେବା ପ୍ରଦାନ କରୁଛନ୍ତି । ଛତିଶଗଡ଼ର ଭଉଣୀଟିଏ ସୀତାଫଳ ସଂଗ୍ରହ କରି ଆଇସକ୍ରିମ ବନେଇ ବ୍ୟବସାୟ କରୁଥିବାବେଳେ ଝାଡ଼ଖଣ୍ଡର ଅଞ୍ଜନ ପ୍ରକାଶଙ୍କ ଭଳି ଦେଶର ଲକ୍ଷ ଲକ୍ଷ ଯୁବକ ଜନଔଷଧି କେନ୍ଦ୍ର ଚଳାଇବା ସଙ୍ଗେ ସଙ୍ଗେ ଆଖପାଖର ଗାଁରେ ଶସ୍ତାରେ ଔଷଧ ଉପଲବ୍ଧ କରାଉଛନ୍ତି । ସେହିଭଳି ବଙ୍ଗଳାର କୌଣସି ଯୁବକ ଯିଏ ତିନିବର୍ଷ ଆଗରୁ ଚାକିରିଟିଏ ଖୋଜୁଥିଲା, ଆଜି ନିଜର ବ୍ୟବସାୟ ସଫଳତାର ସହିତ କରୁଛି । ଖାଲି ସେତିକି ନୁହେଁ ସେ ଦଶ ପନ୍ଦର ଜଣଙ୍କୁ ଚାକିରି ଯୋଗେଇ ଦେଇପାରିଛି । ଏପଟେ ତାମିଲନାଡ଼ୁ, ପଞ୍ଜାବ, ଗୋଆର ସ୍କୁଲ ଛାତ୍ରମାନେ ଏଇ ଛୋଟ ବୟସରେ ନିଜ ସ୍କୁଲର ନବସୃଜନ ପ୍ରୟୋଗଶାଳାରେ ବସି ବର୍ଜ୍ୟବସ୍ତୁ ପରିଚାଳନା ଭଳି ଅତି ଗୁରୁତ୍ୱପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ ବିଷୟରେ କାମ କରୁଛନ୍ତି । ଏହିଭଳି କେଜାଣି କେତେ କେତେ କାହାଣୀ ଅଛି । ଦେଶର ଏମିତି କୌଣସି କୋଣ ନାହିଁ ଯେଉଁଠି ଲୋକମାନଙ୍କ ପାଖରେ ସଫଳତାର କାହାଣୀ ନାହିଁ । ମୋ’ପାଇଁ ଅତ୍ୟନ୍ତ ଖୁସିର କଥା ଯେ ଏହି କାର୍ଯ୍ୟକ୍ରମ ମାଧ୍ୟମରେ ସରକାରଙ୍କ ସଫଳତା ଅପେକ୍ଷା ସାଧାରଣ ମଣିଷର ସଫଳତାର କଥା ତଥା ଦେଶର ଶକ୍ତି, ନୂଆ ଭାରତର ସ୍ୱପ୍ନର ଶକ୍ତି ଆଉ ନୂଆ ଭାରତର ସଂକଳ୍ପର ଶକ୍ତିକୁ ମୁଁ ଅନୁଭବ କରୁଥିଲି । ସମାଜରେ ଏଭଳି କିଛି ଲୋକ ଅଛନ୍ତି – ଯେ’ପର୍ଯ୍ୟନ୍ତ ନିରାଶାର କଥା ନ କହିଥିବେ, ହତାଶାର କଥା ନ କହିଥିବେ, ଅବିଶ୍ୱାସ ସୃଷ୍ଟି କଲାଭଳି କଥା ନ କହିଥିବେ, ଯୋଡ଼ିବା ବଦଳରେ ଭାଙ୍ଗିବାର ରାସ୍ତା ବାହାର ନ କରିଥିବେ ସେପର୍ଯ୍ୟନ୍ତ ତାଙ୍କୁ ଶାନ୍ତି ମିଳିବ ନାହିଁ । ଏଭଳି ବାତାବରଣରେ ସାଧାରଣ ମଣିଷଟିଏ ଯେତେବେଳେ ଏକ ନୂଆ ଆଶା, ନୂତନ ଉତ୍ସାହ ଆଉ ନିଜ ଜୀବନରେ ଘଟିଥିବା ସଫଳତାର କଥା ନେଇ ଆସେ ତାକୁ ସରକାରଙ୍କ ସଫଳତା କୁହାଯାଏନି । ଦୂରଦୂରାନ୍ତର ଏକ ଛୋଟିଆ ଗାଁର ଛୋଟ ବାଳିକାଟିର କଥା ମଧ୍ୟ ଶହେ ପଚିଶ କୋଟି ଜନତାଙ୍କ ପାଇଁ ପ୍ରେରଣା ସ୍ରୋତ ପାଲଟିଯାଏ । ବୈଷୟିକ ଜ୍ଞାନର ସାହାଯ୍ୟରେ ଭିଡ଼ିଓ ବ୍ରିଜ ମାଧ୍ୟମରେ ହିତାଧିକାରୀମାନଙ୍କ ସହିତ କଥାହେବାର ଏହି ସମୟ ମୋ ପାଇଁ ବହୁତ ସୁଖଦ ଏବଂ ପ୍ରେରଣାଦାୟୀ ଥିଲା । ଏହାଦ୍ୱାରା ଆତ୍ମସନ୍ତୋଷ ତ ମିଳେ, ତା’ସଙ୍ଗେ ସଙ୍ଗେ ଅଧିକ କାମ କରିବାର ଉତ୍ସାହ ମଧ୍ୟ ମିଳେ । ଦରିଦ୍ରରୁ ଦରିଦ୍ର ଲୋକଟିଏ ପାଇଁ ସମୟ ଦେଲେ ଏକ ନୂତନ ଆନନ୍ଦ, ଏକ ନୂତନ ଉତ୍ସାହ ଏବଂ ଏକ ନୂତନ ପ୍ରେରଣା ପ୍ରାପ୍ତ ହୋଇଥାଏ ।\nମୁଁ ଦେଶବାସୀମାନଙ୍କ ପାଖରେ କୃତଜ୍ଞ । ଚାଳିଶ-ଚାଳିଶ ପଚାଶ ପଚାଶ ଲକ୍ଷ ଲୋକ ଏହି ଭିଡିଓ ବ୍ରିଜ କାର୍ଯ୍ୟକ୍ରମରେ ସାମିଲ ହେଲେ ଏବଂ ମୋତେ ନୂତନ ଶକ୍ତି ଦେଲେ । ମୁଁ ପୁଣିଥରେ ଆପଣମାନଙ୍କୁ କୃତଜ୍ଞତା ଜଣାଉଛି ।\nମୋର ପ୍ରିୟ ଦେଶବାସୀଗଣ । ମୁଁ ସବୁବେଳେ ଅନୁଭବ କରେ, ଯଦି ଆମେ ଆମର ଆଖପାଖରେ ଦେଖିବା ତ ପାଇବା, କେଉଁଠି ନା କେଉଁଠି, କିଛି ନା କିଛି ଭଲକାମ ହେଉଛି । ଭଲ କାମ କଲାବାଲା ଲୋକ ଅଛନ୍ତି । ଭଲକାମର ସୁଗନ୍ଧ ଆମେ ବି ଅନୁଭବ କରିପାରିବା । ବିଗତ ଦିନମାନଙ୍କରେ ଗୋଟିଏ କଥା ମୋର

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

      "text": "\nNamaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.\nMy dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?\nIt is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.\nMy dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.\nMy dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.\nThank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha\n \nकबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |\nजोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||\n \nThe true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.\n“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय\nयहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nIn another doha, Kabir has written.\nजहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप\nजहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nHe said\nजातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nHe appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,\n“गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|\nबलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय“||\n  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity.\nGuru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .\nMy dear countrymen! The history of India’s struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is – violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!\nMy dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.\nVery few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.\nHe had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation.

Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India’s history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.

For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India’s defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.\nFor Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India – and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.\nMy dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people’s faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone’s life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.\nIn far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!\nThere are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.\nI am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.\nMy dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.\nOn one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers’ participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.\nFriends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.\nMy dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. ‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.\nIn the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.\nMy dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.\nThank you very much."

ہندوستانی ٹیم نے ٹرافی لیتے وقت ، افغانستان کی ٹیم جو کہ پہلی بار بین الاقوامی میچ کھیل رہی تھی، افغانستان کی ٹیم کو بلایا دیا اور دونوں ٹیموں نے ساتھ میں فوٹو لی۔ اسپورٹس مین اسپریٹ کیا ہوتی ہے، اسپورٹس مین شپ کیا ہوتی ہے – اس ایک واقعہ سے ہم محسوس کر سکتے ہیں۔ کھیل سماج کو ایک جٹ کرنے اور ہمارے نوجوانوں کا جو ہنر ہے، ان میں جو ہنرمندی ہے، اسے ڈھونڈھ نکالنے کا ایک بہترین طریقہ ہے۔ ہندوستان اور افغانستان دونوں ٹیموں کو میری مبارکباد ۔ مجھے امید ہے ہم آگے بھی اسی طرح ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ پورے اسپورٹس مین اسپریٹ کے ساتھ کھیلیں گے بھی، کھلیں بھی۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! اس 21 جون کو چوتھے ’یوگا دیوس‘ پر ایک الگ ہی نظارہ تھا۔ پوری دنیا ایک جٹ نظر آئی۔ دنیا بھر میں لوگوں نے پورے جوش و خروش کے ساتھ یوگ ابھیاس کیا۔ بروسیلز میں یوروپین پارلیمنٹ ہو، نیو یارک میں واقع اقوام متحدہ کا ہیڈ کوارٹر ہو، جاپانی بحری فوج کے لڑاکو جہاز ہوں، سبھی جگہ لوگ یوگ کرتے نظر آئے۔ سعودی عرب میں پہلی بار یوگ کا تاریخی پروگرام ہوا اور مجھے بتایا گیا ہے کہ بہت سارے آسنوں کا ڈیمونسٹریشن تو عورتوں نے کیا۔ لداخ کی اونچی برفیلی چوٹیوں پر ہندوستان اور چین کے فوجیوں نے ایک ساتھ مل کر یوگاابھیاس کیا۔ یوگ سبھی سرحدوں کو توڑ کر ، جوڑنے کا کام کرتا ہے۔ سینکڑوں ممالک کے ہزاروں پرجوش لوگوں نے ذات، دھرم، حلقہ، رنگ یا جنس ہر طرح کے تفریق سے باہر جاکر اس موقعے کو ایک بہت بڑا تہوار بنا دیا۔ اگر دنیا بھر کے لوگ اتنے پرجوش ہوکر ’یوگ دوس‘ کے پروگراموں میں حصہ لے رہے تھے تو ہندوستان میں اس کی خوشی کئی گنا کیوں نہیں ہوگی۔\nملک کو فخر ہوتا ہے، جب سوا سو کروڑ لوگ دیکھتے ہیں کہ ہمارے ملک کے حفاظتی دستوں کے جوانوں نے، بری – بحری اور فضائیہ تینوں جگہ یوگ ابھیاس کیا۔ کچھ بہادر فوجیوں نے جہاں آبدوز میں یوگ کیا، وہیں کچھ فوجیوں نے سیاچین کے برفیلے پہاڑوں پر یوگ ابھیاس کیا۔ فضائیہ کے ہمارے لڑاکوں نے تو آساھن میں زمین سے 15 ہزار فٹ کی اونچائی پر یوگاسن کر کے سب کو حیرت میں ڈال دیا۔ دیکھنے والا نظارہ یہ تھا کہ انہوں نے ہوا میں تیرتے ہوئے کیا، نہ کی ہوائی جہاز میں بیٹھ کر کے۔ اسکول ہو، کالج ہو، دفتر ہو، پارک ہو، اونچی عمارت ہو یا کھیل کا میدان ہو، سبھی جگہ یوگ کا مشق ہوا۔ احمد آباد کا ایک منظر تو دل کو چھو لینے والا تھا۔ وہاں پر تقریباً 750 معذور بھائی – بہنوں نے ایک جگہ پر، ایک ساتھ جمع ہوکر یوگ ابھیاس کر کے عالمی ریکارڈ بنا ڈالا۔ یوگ نے ذات، پنتھ اور جغرافیہ سے پرے جاکر دنیا بھر کے لوگوں کو جمع کرنے کا کام کیا ہے۔ ’واسودھیو کُٹمبکم‘ کے جس تاثر کو ہم صدیوں سے جیتے آئے ہیں۔ ہمارے رشی، منی، سنت جس پر ہمیشہ زور دیتے ہیں، یوگ نے اسے صحیح معنی میں ثابت کر کے دکھایا ہے۔ میں مانتا ہوں کہ آج یوگ ایک ویلنیس، انقلاب کا کام کر رہا ہے۔ میں امید کرتا ہوں کہ یوگ سے ویل نیس کی جو ایک مہم چلی ہے، وہ آگے بڑھے گی۔ زیادہ سے زیادہ لوگ اسے اپنی زندگی کا حصہ بنائیں گے۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں ! مائی گوو اور نریندر مودی ایپ پر کئی لوگوں نے مجھے لکھا کہ میں اس بار کی ’من کی بات‘ میں ایک جولائی کو آنے والے ڈاکٹرس ڈے کے بارے میں بات کرو ں۔ صحیح بات ہے۔ ہم مصیبت کے وقت ہی ڈاکٹر کو یاد کرتے ہیں لیکن یہ ایک ایسا دن ہے، جب ملک ہمارے ڈاکٹرس کی حصولیابیوں کو سیلیبریٹ کرتا ہے اور سماج کے تئیں ان کی خدمات اور عہد بندی کے لیے انہیں بہت بہت مبارکباد دیتا ہوں۔ ہم وہ لوگ ہیں، جو فطری طور پر ماں کو بھگوان کے طور ر پوجتے ہیں، بھگوان کے برابر مانتے ہیں کیونکہ ماں ہمیں زندگی دیتی ہے، ماں ہمیں جنم دیتی ہے، تو کئی بار ڈاکٹر ہمیں دوبارہ زندگی دیتا ہے۔ ڈاکٹر کا رول صرف بیماریوں کا علاج کرنے تک ہی محدود نہیں ہے۔ اکثر ڈاکٹر خاندان کے دوست کی طرح ہوتے ہیں۔ ہمارے لائف اسٹائل گائڈس ہیں۔ ’’دے ناٹ اونلی کیور بٹ السو ہیل‘‘۔ آج ڈاکٹر کے پاس میڈیکل ایکسپرٹیز تو ہوتی ہی ہے، ساتھ ہی ان کے پاس جنرل لائف اسٹائل ٹرینڈس کے بارے میں، اس کا ہمارے صحت پر کیا اثر پڑتا ہے، ان سب کے بارے میں گہرا تجربہ ہوتا ہے۔ ہندوستانی ڈاکٹروں نے اپنی قابلیت اور مہارت سے پوری دنیا میں اپنی پہچان بنائی ہے۔ میڈیکل پروفیشن میں مہارت، سخت محنت کے ساتھ ساتھ ہمارے ڈاکٹر کمپلیکس میڈیکل پروبلیمس کو سالو کرنے کے لیے جانے جاتے ہیں۔ ’من کی بات‘ کے ذریعے سے میں سبھی ہم وطنوں کی جانب سے ہمارے سبھی ڈاکٹر ساتھیوں کو آئندہ 1 جولائی کو آنے والے ڈاکٹرس ڈے کی بہت بہت مبارکباد دیتا ہوں۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! ہم ایسے قسمت والے لوگ ہیں جو کا اس ہندوستان کی سرزمین پر پیدا ہوئے ہیں۔ ہندوستان کی ایک ایسی وسیع تاریخ رہی ہے، جب کوئی ایسا مہینہ نہیں ہے، کوئی ایسا دن نہیں ہے، جس میں کوئی نہ کوئی تاریخی واقعہ نہ ہوا ہو۔ دیکھیں تو ہندوستان میں ہر جگہ کی اپنی ایک وراثت ہے۔ وہاں سے جڑا کوئی سنت ہے، کوئی مہاپرش ہے، کوئی مشہور آدمی ہے، سبھی کا اپنا اپنا تعاون ہے، اپنی قابلیت ہے۔\nآ پ کے فون کال کے لیے بہت بہت شکریہ۔ یہ صحیح ہے کہ میں 28 تاریخ کو مگہر آ رہا ہوں اور ویسے بھی جب میں گجرات میں تھا، گجرات کا کبیروڈ تو آپ اچھی طرح جانتے ہیں۔ جب میں وہاں کام کرتا تھا تو میں نے ایک سنت کبیر کی روایت سے جڑے لوگوں کا ایک بڑا، ایک قومی اجلاس بھی کیا تھا۔ آپ لوگ جانتے ہیں، کبیر داس جی مگہر کیوں گئے تھے؟ اس وقت ایک کہاوت تھی کہ مگہر میں جس کی موت ہوتی ہے، وہ سورگ نہیں جاتا۔ اس کے الٹ کاشی میں جس کی موت ہوتی ہے وہ سورگ جاتا ہے۔ مگہر کو ناپاک مانا جاتا تھا لیکن سنت کبیرداس اس پر یقین نہیں کرتے تھے۔ اپنے وقت کی ایسی ہی غلط رواج کو انہوں نے توڑنے کا کام کیا اور اس لیے وہ مگہر گئے اور وہیں ان کی موت ہوئی۔ سنت کبیرداس جی نے اپنی ساکھیوں اور دوہوں کے ذریعے سے سماجی یکسانیت، امن اور بھائی چارے پر زور دیا۔ یہی ان کے نظریات تھے۔ ان کی تخلیقات میں ہمیں یہی نظریات دیکھنے کو ملتے ہیں اور آج کے دور میں بھی وہ اتنے ہی تحریک دینے والے ہیں۔ ان کا ایک دوہا ہے:\n \nکبیر سوئی پیر ہے،  جو جانے پر پیر۔ |\nجو پر پیر نہ جان ہی ،   سو کا پیر میں پیر۔ ||\n \nمطلب سچا پیر سنت وہی ہے جو دوسروں کے دکھ کو جانتا اور سمجھتا ہے، جو دوسرے کے دکھ کو نہیں جانتے وہ بے درد ہے۔ کبیر داس جی نے سماجی یکسانیت پر خاص توجہ دی تھی۔ وہ اپنے وقت سے بہت آگے سوچتے تھے۔ اس وقت جب دنیا میں گراوٹ اور جدوجہد کا دور چل رہا تھا انہوں نے امن اور بھائی چارے کا پیغام دیا اور لوگوں کو ایک ساتھ کر کے من مٹاؤں کو دور کرنے کا کام کیا۔\n“’’جگ میں بیری کوئی نہیں، جو من شیتل ہوئے۔\nیہ آپا تو ڈال دے،  دیا کرے سب کوئے۔‘‘”\nThere will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.\nCompassion should be the universal way of life.\nایک دوسرے دوہے میں کبیر لکھتے ہیں –\n’’جہاں دیا تہم دھرم ہے،  جہاں لوبھ تہاں پاپ۔\nجہاں کرودھ تہاں کال ہے، جہاں چھما تہاں آپ۔‘‘\nCompassion leads to righteousness,\nGreed leads to sin.\nAnger is sure to devour you,\nForgiveness is a great virtue.\nانہوں نے کہا :\n’’ذات نہ پوچھو سادھو کی،  پوچھ لیجیے گیان۔\nNever ask a saint his caste or creed;\nAsk him about his repository of knowledge.\nاور لوگوں سے اپیل کی کہ وہ ذات پات سے اوپر اٹھ کر لوگوں کو علم کے طور پر مانیں، ان کی عزت کریں، ان کی باتیں صدیوں بعد بھی اتنی ہی اثردار ہے۔ ابھی جب ہم سنت کبیرداس جی کے بارے میں بات کر رہے ہیں تو مجھے ان کا ایک دوہا یاد آتا ہے۔ جس میں وہ کہتے ہیں :\n“’’گرو گووند دو او کھڑے ، کاکے لاگو پا ئے|\nبلیہاری گرو آپ نے، , گووند دیو بتائے۔‘‘“||\nایسی ہوتی ہے گرو کی مہانتا اور ایسے ہی ایک گرو ہیں، جگت گرو – گرو نانک دیو۔ جنہوں نے کوٹی کوٹی لوگوں کو سچا راستہ دکھایا، صدیوں سے ترغیب دیتے رہے۔ گرو نانک دیو نے سماج میں ذات پات کے تفریق کو ختم کرنے اور بنی نوع انسان کو ایک مانتے ہوئے انہیں گلے لگانے کی تعلیم دی۔\nایسی ہوتی ہے گرو کی مہانتا اور ایسے ہی ایک گرو ہیں، جگت گرو – گرو نانک دیو۔ جنہوں نے کوٹی کوٹی لوگوں کو سچا راستہ دکھایا، صدیوں سے ترغیب دیتے رہے۔ گرو نانک دیو نے سماج میں ذات پات کے تفریق کو ختم کرنے اور بنی نوع انسان کو ایک مانتے ہوئے انہیں گلے لگانے کی تعلیم دی۔ گرو نانک دیو کہتے تھے غریبوں اور ضرورتمنوں کی خدمت ہی بھگوان کی خدمت ہے۔ وہ جہاں بھی گئے انہوں نے سماج کی بھلائی کے لیے کئی پہل کی۔ سماجی تفریق سے پاک رسوئی کا انتظام جہاں ہر ذات، مذہب یا کمیونٹی کا فرد آکر کھانا کھا سکتا تھا۔ گرو نانک دیو نے ہی تو اس لنگر نظام کی شروعات کی۔ 2019 میں گرو نانک دیو جی کا 550واں پرکاش پرو منایا جائے گا۔ میں چاہتا ہوں ہم سب لوگ جوش کے ساتھ اس سے جڑیں۔ آپ لوگوں سے بھی میری درخواست ہے گرو نانک دیو جی کے 550ویں پرکاش پرو پر پورے سماج میں اور دنیا بھر میں اسے کیسے منایا جائے، نئے نئے آئیڈیا کیا ہوں، نئے نئے مشورہ کیا ہوں، نئے نئے خیالات کیا ہوں، اس پر ہم سوچیں، تیاریاں کریں اور فخر کے ساتھ اس کو ہم سب، اس  پرکاش پرو  کو  پریرنا پرو  بھی بنائیں۔ .\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! ہندوستان کی آزادی کی جدوجہد بہت لمبی ہے، بہت وسیع ہے، بہت گہری ہے، بے حساب شہادتوں سے بھری پڑی ہے۔ پنجاب سے جڑی ایک اور تاریخ ہے۔ 2019 میں جلیاں والا باغ کی اس خوفناک واقعہ کے بھی 100 سال پورے ہو رہے ہیں جس نے پورے بنی نوع کو شرم سار کر دیا تھا۔ 13 اپریل ، 1919 کا وہ کالا دن کون بھول سکتا ہے جب طاقت کا غلط استعمال کر کے بے رحمی کی ساری حدیں پار کر کے بے گناہ اور معصوم لوگوں پر گولیاں چلائی گئی تھیں۔ اس واقعہ کے 100 سال پورے ہونے والے ہیں۔ اسے ہم کیسے یاد کریں، ہم سب اس پر سوچ سکتے ہیں، لیکن اس واقعہ نے جو امر پیغام دیا، اسے ہم ہمیشہ یار رکھیں۔ یہ تشدد اور ظلم سے کبھی کسی مسئلہ کا حل نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔ جیت ہمیشہ امن اور عدم تشدد کی ہوتی ہے، قربانی کی ہوتی ہے۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! دلی کے روہنی کے جناب رمن کمار نے نریندر مودی موبائل ایپ پر لکھا ہے کہ آنے والی 6 جولائی کو ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کا یوم پیدائش ہے اور وہ چاہتے ہیں کہ اس پروگرام میں ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کے بارے میں ہم وطنوں سے بات کروں۔ رمن جی سب سے پہلے تو آپ کا بہت بہت شکریہ۔ ہندوستان کی تاریخ میں آپ کی دلچسپی دیکھ کر کافی اچھا لگا۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، کل ہی ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کی سالگرہ تھی 23 جون کو۔ ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کئی شعبوں سے جڑے رہے لیکن جو شعبہ ان کے سب سے قریب رہے وہ تھے تعلیم، انتظامیہ اور پارلیمنٹری افیئرس ، بہت کم لوگوں کو پتہ ہوگا کہ وہ کولکتہ یونیورسٹی کے سب سے کم عمر کے وائس چانسلر تھے۔ جب وہ وائس چانسلر بنے تھے تب ان کی عمر صرف 33 سال تھی۔\nبہت کم لوگ جانتے ہوں گے کہ 1937 میں ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کی دعوت پر جناب گرو دیو رویندر ناتھ ٹیگور نے کولکتہ یونیورسٹی میں کونووکیشن کو بنگلہ زبان میں خطاب کیا تھا۔ یہ پہلا موقع تھا، جب انگریزوں کی سلطنت تھی اور کولکتہ میں کسی نے بنگلہ زبان میں کونووکیشن کو خطاب کیا تھا۔ 1947 سے 1950 تک ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی ہندوستان کے پہلے صنعت کے وزیر رہے اور ایک معنی میں کہیں تو انہوں نے ہندوستان کی صنعتی ترقی کی مضبوط بنیاد رکھی تھی ، ایک مضبوط پلیٹ فارم تیار کیا تھا۔ 1948 میں آئی آزاد ہندوستان کی پہلی صنعتی پالیسی ان کے آئڈیاز اور ویژن کی چھاپ لے کر کے آئی تھی۔ ڈاکٹر مکھرجی کا خواب تھا کہ ہندوستان ہر شعبے میں صنعتی طور سے خود مختار ہو، ہنرمند اور وسیع ہو۔\nوہ چاہتے تھے کہ ہندوستان بڑی صنعتوں کو ڈیولپ کریں اور ساتھ ہی ایم ایس ایم ای ، ہتھ کرگھا، کپڑا اور چھوٹی صنعت پر بھی پوری توجہ دیں۔ کٹیر اور چھوٹی صنعتوں کی پوری ترقی کے لیے انہیں فنانس اور آرگنائزیشن سیٹ اپ ملے، اس کے لیے 1948 سے 1950 کے درمیان آل انڈیا ہینڈی کرافٹس بورڈ، آل انڈیا ہینڈلوم بورڈ اور کھادی اینڈ ویلیج انڈسٹریز بورڈ قائم کیے گئے تھے۔ ڈاکٹر مکھرجی کا ہندوستان کے دفاعی پروڈکشن کے سودیشی کرن پر بھی خاص زور تھا۔ چترنجن لوکوموٹیو ورکس فیکٹری، ہندوستان ایئرکرافٹ فیکٹری، سندری کا کھاد کارخانہ اور دامودر گھاٹی نگم، یہ چار سب سے کامیاب اور بڑے پروجیکٹس اور دوسرے ریور ویلی پروجیکٹس کے قیام میں ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کا بہت بڑا تعاون تھا۔ مغربی بنگال کی ترقی کو لے کر وہ کافی جذباتی تھے۔ ان کی سمجھ، دانش مندی اور سرگرمی کا ہی نتیجہ ہے کہ بنگلہ کا ایک حصہ بچایا جا سکا اور وہ آج بھی ہندوستان کا حصہ ہے۔\nڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کے لیے، جو سب سے اہم بات تھی، وہ تھی ہندوستان کی صداقت اور اتحاد – اور اسی کے لیے 52 سال کی کم عمر میں ہی انہیں اپنی جان گنوانی پڑی۔ آیئے۔ ہم ہمیشہ ڈاکٹر شیاما پرساد مکھرجی کے یکجہتی کے پیغام کو یاد رکھیں، یکجہتی اور بھائی چارے کی سوچ کے ساتھ ، ہندوستان کی ترقی کے لیے جی جان سے جڑے رہیں۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! گزشتہ کچھ ہفتوں میں مجھے ویڈیو کال کے ذریعے سے حکومت کی مختلف منصوبوں کے استفادہ کنندگان سے بات کرنے کا موقع ملا۔ فائلوں سے باہر جاکر لوگوں کی زندگی میں جو تبدیلی آ رہی ہے، ان کے بارے میں براہ راست انہیں سے جاننے کا موقع ملا۔ لوگوں نے اپنے عزم، اپنے سکھ دکھ ، اپنی حصولیابیوں کے بارے میں بتایا۔ میں مانتا ہوں کہ میرے لیے یہ محض ایک سرکاری پروگرام نہیں تھا بلکہ یہ ایک الگ طرح کا لرننگ تجربہ تھا اور اس دوران لوگوں کے چہرے پر جو خوشیاں دیکھنے کو ملیں، اس سے بڑا سکون کا لمحہ کسی کی بھی زندگی میں کیا ہو سکتا ہے؟ جب ایک عام انسان کی کہانیاں سنتا تھا۔ ان کے بھولے بھالے جملے اپنے تجربے کی کہانی وہ جو کہہ رہے تھے، دل کو چھو جاتی تھی۔\nدور دراز کے گاؤوں میں بیٹیاں کامن سروس سینٹر کے ذریعے سے گاؤوں کے بزرگوں کی پنشن سے لے کر پاسپورٹ بنوانے تک کے خدمات دستیاب کروا رہی ہیں۔ جب چھتیس گڑھ کی کوئی بہن سیتاپھل کو جما کر اس کی آئس کریم بنا کر روزگار کرتی ہے۔ جھارکھنڈ میں انجن پرکاش کی طرح ملک کے لاکھوں نوجوان ادویاتی مرکز چلانے کے ساتھ ساتھ آس پاس کے گاؤوں میں جاکر سستی دوائیاں دستیاب کروا رہے ہوں۔ وہیں مغربی بنگال کا کوئی نوجوان دو تین سال پہلے نوکری ڈھونڈھ رہا ہو اور اب وہ صرف اپنا کامیاب روزگار کر رہا ہے؛ اتنا ہی نہیں، دس پندرہ لوگوں کو اور نوکری بھی دے رہا ہے۔ ادھر تمل ناڈو، پنجاب، گوا کے اسکول کے طالب علم اپنی چھوٹی عمر میں اسکول کی ٹنکرنگ لیب میں ویسٹ مینجمنٹ جیسے اہم موضوع پر کام کر رہے ہوں۔ نہ جانے کتنی کتنی کہانیاں تھیں۔ ملک کا کوئی کونا ایسا نہیں ہوگا جہاں لوگوں کو اپنی کامیابی کی بات کہنی نہ ہو۔ مجھے خوشی اس بات کی ہے ان تمام پروگرام میں حکومت کی کامیابی سے زیادہ عام انسان کی کامیابی کی باتیں ملک کی قوت، نئے ہندوستان کے خوابوں کی طاقت، نئے ہندوستان کے عزم کی قوت – اسے میں محسوس کر رہا تھا۔\nسماج میں کچھ لوگ ہوتے ہیں۔ وہ جب تک مایوسی کی باتیں نہ کریں، غیریقینی پیدا کرنے کی کوشش نہ کریں، جوڑنے کے بجائے توڑنے کے راستے نہ کھوجیں، تب تک ان کو سکون نہیں ہوتا ہے۔ ایسے ماحول میں عام انسان جب نئی امید، نئے جوش اور اپنی زندگی میں ہونے والے واقعات کی بات لے کر کے آتا ہے تو وہ سرکار کا کریڈٹ نہیں ہوتا۔ دور دراز ایک چھوٹے سے گاؤں کی چھوٹی سی بچی کا واقعہ بھی سوا سو کروڑ ہم وطنوں کے لیے ترغیب بن جاتا ہے۔ میرے لیے ٹیکنالوجی کی مدد سے، ویڈیو بریج کے ذریعے سے استفادہ کنندگان کے ساتھ وقت گزارنے کا ایک لمحہ بہت ہی سکون دینے والا ، بہت ہی ترغیب دینے والا رہا اور اس سے کام کرنے کا سکون تو ملتا ہی ہے لیکن اور زیادہ کام کرنے کا جذبہ بھی ملتا ہے۔ غریب سے غریب شخص کے لیے زندگی گزارنے کا ایک اور نیا خوشی، ایک اور نئی جوش اور نئی ترغیبات حاصل ہوتی ہیں۔\nمیں ہم وطنوں کا بہت شکر گزار ہوں۔ 40-40، 50-50 لاکھ لوگ اس ویڈیو بریج کے پروگرام میں جڑے اور مجھے نئی قوت دینے کا کام آپ نے کیا۔ میں پھر ایک بار آپ سب کا شکریہ ادا کرنا چاہتا ہوں۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! میں ہمیشہ محسوس کرتا ہوں، اگر ہم اپنے آس پاس دیکھیں تو کہیں نہ کہیں کچھ نہ کچھ اچھا ہوتا ہے۔ اچھا کرنے والے لوگ ہوتے ہیں۔ اچھائی کی خوشبو ہم بھی محسوس کر سکتے ہیں۔ گزشتہ دنوں ایک بات میرے ذہن میں آئی اور یہ بڑا منفرد مجموعہ ہے۔ اس میں ایک جانب جہاں پروفیشنلز اور انجینئرس ہیں وہیں دوسری جانب کھیت میں کام کرنے والے ، کھیتی سے جڑے ہمارے کسان بھائی بہن ہیں۔ اب آپ سوچ رہے ہوں گے کہ یہ تو دو بالکل الگ الگ صنعت ہیں – ان کا کیا تعلق؟ لیکن ایسا ہے، بینگلورو میں کارپوریٹ پروفیشنلس، آئی ٹی انجینئرس ساتھ آئے۔ انہوں نے مل کر ایک آسان ’سمردھی ٹرسٹ‘ بنایا ہے اور انہوں نے کسانوں کی آمدنی دوگنی ہو، اس کے لیے اس ٹرسٹ کو ایکٹیویٹ کیا۔ کسانوں سے جڑتے گئے، منصوبے بناتے گئے اور کسانوں کی آمدنی بڑھانے کے لیے کامیاب کوشش کرتے رہے۔ کھیتی کی نئی تکنیک سکھانے کے ساتھ ساتھ حیاتیاتی کھیتی کیسے کی جائے؟ کھیتوں میں ایک فصل کے ساتھ ساتھ اور بھی فصل کیسے اگائی جائے؟ یہ ٹرسٹ کے ذریعے ان پروفیشنلز ، انجینئر، ٹیکنوکریٹ کے ذریعے کسانوں کو ٹریننگ دی جانے لگی۔ پہلے جو کسان اپنے کھیتوں میں ایک ہی فصل پر منحصر ہوا کرتے تھے۔ اپج بھی اچھی نہیں ہوتی تھی اور منافع بھی زیادہ نہیں ہوتا تھا۔ آج وہ نہ صرف سبزیاں اگا رہے ہیں اور بلکہ اپنی سبزیوں کی مارکیٹنگ بھی ٹرسٹ کے ذریعے سے کر کے، اچھی قیمت حاصل کر رہے ہیں۔ اناج پیدا کرنے والے کسان بھی اس سے جڑے ہوئے ہیں۔\nایک طرف فصل کی پیداوار سے لے کر مارکیٹنگ تک پوری چین میں کسانوں کا ایک اہم رول ہے تو دوسری جانب منافع میں کسانوں کی حصہ داری کو یقینی بنانا ان کے حق کو یقینی بنانے کی کوشش ہے۔ فصل اچھی ہو، اس کے لیے اچھی نسل کے بیج ہوں۔ اس کے لیے الگ سیڈ بینک بنایا گیا ہے۔ خواتین اس سیڈ بینک کا کام دیکھتی ہیں۔ خواتین کو بھی جوڑا گیا ہے۔ میں ان نوجوانوں کو اس اہم تجربہ کے لیے بہت بہت مبارکباد دیتا ہوں اور مجھے خوشی ہے کہ پروفیشنلس، ٹیکنوکریٹ، انجینئرنگ کی دنیا سے جڑے ان نوجوانوں نے اپنے دائرے سے باہر نکل کر کے کسان کے ساتھ جڑنا، گاؤں کے ساتھ جڑنا، کھیت کے ساتھ جڑنے کا جو راستہ اپنایا ہے۔ میں پھر ایک بار اپنے ملک کی نوجوان نسل کو ان کے ان اہم تجربوں، کو کچھ جو شاید میں نے جانا ہوگا، کچھ نہیں جانا ہوگا، کچھ لوگوں کو پتہ ہوگا، کچھ پتہ نہیں ہوگا لیکن مسلسل لوگ کچھ نہ کچھ اچھا کر رہے ہیں، ان سب کو میری طرف سے بہت بہت مبارکباد ۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں ! جی ایس ٹی کو ایک سال پورا ہونے والا ہے۔ ’ون نیشن، ون ٹیکس‘ ملک کے لوگوں کا خواب تھا، وہ آج حقیقت میں بدل چکا ہے۔ ون نیشن ون تیکس ریفارم، اس کے لیے اگر مجھے سب سے زیادہ کسی کو کریڈٹ دینا ہے تو میں ریاستوں کو کریڈٹ دیتا ہوں۔ جی ایس ٹی کوآپریٹیو فیڈرالزم کی ایک بہترین مثال ہے، جہاں سبھی ریاستوں نے مل کر ملک کے حق میں فیصلہ لیا اور تب جاکر ملک میں اتنا بڑا ٹیکس ریفارم نافذ ہو سکا۔ اب تک جی ایس ٹی کونسل کی 27 میٹنگ ہوئی ہیں اور ہم سب فخر کر سکتے ہیں کہ مختلف سیاسی سوچ والے لوگ وہاں بیٹھتے ہیں، مختلف ریاستوں کے لوگ بیٹھتے ہیں، الگ الگ پرائیوریٹی والے ریاست ہوتے ہیں لیکن اس کے باوجود بھی جی ایس ٹی کونسل میں اب تک جتنے بھی فیصلہ کیے گئے ہیں، وہ سارے سب کی مرضی سے کیے گئے ہیں۔ جی ایس ٹی سے پہلے ملک میں 17 الگ الگ طرح کے ٹیکس ہوا کرتے تھے لیکن اس نظام میں اب صرف ایک ہی ٹیکس پورے ملک میں نافذ ہے۔ جی ایس ٹی ایمانداری کی جیت ہے اور ایمانداری کا ایک تہوار بھی ہے۔ پہلے ملک میں کافی بار ٹیکس کے معاملے میں انسپکٹر راج کی شکایتیں آتی رہتی تھیں۔\nجی ایس ٹی میں انسپکٹر کی جگہ آئی ٹی نے انفارمیشن ٹیکنالوجی نے لے لی ہے۔ ریٹرن سے لے کر ریفنڈ تک سب کچھ آن لائن انفارمیشن ٹیکنالوجی کے ذریعے ہوتا ہے۔ جی ایس ٹی کے آنے سے چیک پوسٹ ختم ہو گئی اور مال سامانوں کی آمد و رفت تیز ہو گئی، جس سے نہ صرف وقت بچ رہا ہے بلکہ لاجسٹکس کے شعبے میں بھی اس کا کافی فائدہ مل رہا ہے۔ جی ایس ٹی شاید دنیا کا سب سے بڑا ٹیکس ریفارم ہوگا۔ ہندوستان میں اتنا بڑا ٹیکس ریفارم کامیاب اس لیے ہو پایا کیونکہ ملک کے عوام نے اسے اپنایا اور اتنا بڑا ریفارم ، اتنا بڑا ملک، اتنی بڑی آبادی اس کو پوری طرح سے مستحکم ہونے میں 5 سے 7 سال کا وقت لگتا ہے لیکن ملک کے ایماندار لوگوں کا جوش ، ملک کی ایمانداری کا تہوار لوگوں کی حصہ داری کا نتیجہ ہے کہ ایک سال کے اندر اندر یہ نیا ٹیکس نظام اپنی جگہ بنا چکا ہے، استحکام حاصل کر چکا ہے اور ضرورت کے مطابق اپنی ان بلٹ نظام کے ذریعے وہ اصلاح بھی کرتا رہتا ہے۔ یہ اپنے آپ میں ایک بہت بڑی کامیابی سوا سو کروڑ ہم وطنوں نے حاصل کی ہے۔\nمیرے پیارے ہم وطنوں! پھر ایک بار ’من کی بات‘ کو ختم کرتے ہوئے اگلے من کی بات کا انتظار کر رہا ہوں، آپ سے ملنے کا، آپ سے باتیں کرنے کا۔ آپ کو بہت بہت مبارکباد۔\nبہت بہت شکریہ۔"
